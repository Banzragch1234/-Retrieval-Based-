Temujin's Origin and Early Life
1. Börte-chino, a descendant of Genghis Khan and born from heaven, crossed the
sea with his wife Gua-Maral and settled on Mount Burkhan Khaldun, the source of
the Onon River, and gave birth to a son named Batsagaan.
2. Tamacha, the son of Batsagaan, Khorichar the wise, Khorichar the wise's
son Uujim Buural, Uujim Buural's son Sal-khachau, Sal-khachau's son
Ikhnuden, Ikhnuden's son Shinsochi, Shinsochi's son Kharchu.
3. Borjigidai, the wise man, is the son of Kharchu. Borjigidai, the wise man's wife is
Mongoljingua, and his son is Torgoljin Bayan. Torgoljin Bayan, the wise man, has a
wife named Borogchingua, a young servant named Boroldaisuyalbi, and two horses.
Torgoljin Bayan's sons are Duva Sohor and Dobu Wise Man. 4. Duva Sohor, the wise
man, has one eye in his forehead, and three nomadic people.
5. One day, Lord Duva went up to the mountain with his blind brother and Dobu his wise
brother. Duva is blind, if God looks from above, a group of citizens will move to Tunkheleg
stream.
6. Duwa the blind man said, "In that nomadic village, in front of the cart stall, there is a
beautiful girl sitting. If you have not yet found a wife, wise brother Dobu will ask you to
marry her." So he sent his wise brother Dobu to show her to him.
7. The wise man, when he reached the village, saw the girl, and he found that she was a very famous and
beautiful girl, and had never been married to anyone. Her name was Alun Gua.
8. This girl was born to Bargujin Gua, the wife of Khorilardai the Wise, the lord of the Hori Tumd,
in a place called Arig Us, a land of the Hori Tumd (Khori Buryats). Her mother Bargujin Gua was
the daughter of Bargudai the Wise, the lord of the Bargujin Tokhum in a distant land. That group
of people belonged to Khorilardai the Wise.
9. The wise man Horilardai, who had forbidden the hunting of deer such as sable and squirrel in
the lands of the Hori Tumans, quarreled with each other and separated. He heard that the Horilar
tribe had abundant deer in the Burhan Khaldun Mountains and moved to meet the Shinch Bayan
Uriankhai, the lord of Burhan Khaldun. This is how the ruler of the Hori Tumans asked for Alun-
gua, the daughter of the wise man Horilardai, who was born in the Ari river, and made her the wife
of the wise man Dobu.
10. Alun-gua came to the wise man Dobu and gave birth to two sons named
Beludu and Belgunu.
11. Duwa, the blind brother, had four sons. After Duwa died, his four sons, not
considering Dobu the wise man as their uncle, separated and moved away,
becoming four clans.
12. One day, when Dobu the Wise Togotsog went out to hunt on a high mountain,
he met a man in the forest who was killing a deer and roasting its ribs.
13. When the wise man said, "My friend, take the spear," the man took the spear
and the skin himself and gave the rest to the wise man.
14. As the wise man Dobu was carrying deer meat, he met a poor man on the road who was carrying
his child.
15. "What kind of person are you?" asked the wise man Dobu. The man replied, "I
am from Maligba. I am tired now. Give me some of the meat of that deer. I will
give you my son."
16. The wise man Dobu agreed, gave the man the leg of the deer, and brought the
boy home to serve him.
17. Meanwhile, the wise man Dobu passed away. After the wise man Dobu passed away
His wife, Alun-gua, became pregnant and gave birth to three sons,
Bukha Khatagi, Bukhatu Salji, and Bodonchar Munkhag.
18. The two sons Belgunu and Begudu, who were born during the lifetime of the wise
man Dobu, discussed this with their mother Alun-gua: "Our mother, without a male
relative or a male relative, gave birth to these three sons. There is only one servant of
the Malig Begud clan in the house. These three sons are his children," Alun-gua learned
of their discussion with their mother.
19. One spring day, Belgunutei, Beseduutei, Bukha Khatagi, Bukhatu Salji, and Bodonchar
cooked dried mutton and fed it to their five foolish sons. They sat them down side by side,
gave each one a stick (or thin stick) to break, and when they were told to break it, they easily
broke it. Also, when they tied five sticks together and told them to break them, they could not
break all five of them in a row.
20. At this, Alun-gua's mother said: "You and Belgunu and Pedebu are
suspicious about how I gave birth to these three sons, and whose sons they
are. Your suspicions are correct.
21. But you do not know why. Every night, a white-yellow man, shining with a household
lamp, comes and touches my belly, and his light penetrates my belly. That man, like the
rising sun, appears yellow like a yellow dog on the border of the moon. What do you say
in vain? From that, they are the sons of heaven. Why do you compare them to a black
man? When the king becomes the most powerful, the black man will know why."
22. And Alun-gua, having instructed his five sons, said: "You five sons, are not born
from my one womb. If you separate yourselves, you will be as sharp as arrows, and
easily defeated by men. If you unite, you will be as sharp as five arrows, and easily
defeated by no one." At that moment, Alun-gua's mother passed away.
23. After the death of mother Alun-gua, the five brothers decided to divide their property and livestock. Belgunu, Peydugu,
Bukha Khatagi, and Bukhatu Salji divided their property among the four of them, and Bodonchar, the younger brother, was
considered a fool and did not give him a share, disregarding his inheritance.
24. Bodonchar is not counted in the womb, so what are you doing here? The tailed orog Shinkhul
rode his horse, thinking, "If I die, I will die, if I live, I will live," and set off towards the Onon River.
There, he arrived at a place called Baljian Island and built a grass hut.
25. Meanwhile, he saw a black sparrow catching and eating a brown bear, so he
set a trap with a pair of horsehair snakes and caught the brown bear.
26. Bodonchar, because he had nothing to eat, would hunt down and kill the deer that the wolves had caught, or
he would pick up the carcasses that the wolves had eaten, feeding his stomach and feeding his eyes. That year
passed.
27. When spring comes and the ducks come, keep your eyes peeled and kill many geese and ducks, so that they won't be
able to eat them.
From every branch
Hanging limbs
From every corner
Two or three
The bird that was given has rotted.
28. A group of people from the dense forest moved to the Tunkheleg stream. Bodonchar, keeping an eye
on them, went to the people every day to ask for food and drink, and at night, the group returned home to
eat grass and spend the night.
29. They asked for the citizen Bodonchar's face, but he refused. They did not ask the citizen, who
Bodonchar was, and Bodonchar did not ask the citizen why he was a citizen. 30. However, Bukha Khatagi's
brother came to ask Bodonchar, his foolish brother, that he had gone to the Odon River, and when they
reached the citizen, who lived in the Tunkheleg River, they asked if such a horse and such a man had been
seen,
31. They told the villagers: "Every day a man comes to the mountain to drink eseg (tsegee). That
man and his horse are like your students. He has a scythe. He does not know where he spends
the night. When the wind blows from the northwest, the duck and goose feathers caught by his
scythe will be scattered like snow. If you think about it, his home is not far away. Now is the
time for him to come. Wait a moment."
32. Soon a man came running up the Tunkheleg River. When he arrived, it was Bodonchar. His
brother, Bukha Khatagi, recognized him and rode with him up the Onon River.
33. Bodonchar, Bukha Khatagi, followed behind the elder brother and said, "Brother, brother, the one with
the head and the collar of the robe is good," but the elder brother ignored her words.
34. When Bodonchar said the same thing a second time, his brother did not answer. When
he said the same thing a third time, his brother said, "Why do you say that thing again and
again?"
35. Bodonchar said: "The citizens of Tugaar (the million) who have no master, big
and small, good and bad, and bald are all the same. Since they are such easy
citizens, let us conquer them."
36. His brother said: "Well then, let's go home and consult with our brothers, and let
them take over the city."
37. When he arrived home, he consulted with the brothers and set out. The
leaders also sent Bodonchar.
38. Bodonchar led the way and caught a pregnant woman and asked her, "What kind of person
are you?" The woman replied, "I am a man of the Adankhan Uriankhai tribe." 39. From there,
the five brothers attacked the people, took their horses and cattle, and made them slaves.
40. That pregnant woman came to Bodonchar and gave birth to a son. He was called
Jajiradai, because he was a son of a foreign tribe. He became the ancestor of Jadaran.
That son of Jajiradai was called Tugudai. Tugudai's son was Buri-bulchiru, Buri-
bulchiru's son was Khar-khadaan. Khar-khadaan's son was Jamuha. They became the
Jadaran tribe. (Jada means foreign tribe).
41. That woman also gave birth to a son from Bodonchar. He was named Baardai, because he was the son
of the woman who had taken him. He became the ancestor of Baar. Baardai's son was Zutgalboh, and
Zutgalboh took many wives, so his sons were as numerous as Manan. They became the descendants of
Manan Baar.
42. Belgunutei, became the Belgunud tribe. Beguudei, became the Bayanud tribe. Buha became the
Khatagi, became the Khatagin tribe. Buhatu became the Salji, became the Saljid tribe. Bodonchar,
became the Borjigin tribe.
43. Barim Shiratu Habich, born of Bodonchar's first wife, was a son named Habich. Bodonchar took
the woman who came as a dowry to the mother of the hero Habich as a concubine and gave birth to
a son named Jaurdai. While Bodonchar was alive, Jaurdai was given a husband who would be
cursed.
44. After Bodonchar's death, he dismissed Jaurdai as his son, as he was always a
humble man in the house. He became the ancestor of Jeuret.
45. Habich hero's son Menen tudun group. Khachi Khulug, Khachin, Khachiu,
Khachula, Haraldai, Khachiun, and Nachin hero from Menen tudun.
46. The son of Hachi Khulu, Haidu, was born from the mother of Namulun. The son of Hachin was called
Noyogidai. He became the Noyohon clan because he had a noble character. The son of Hachiu was called
Baruladai. He became the Barulas clan because he was tall and had a passion for eating. The son of
Hachula was also called the Great Barula and the Little Barula because he had a passion for eating, and
then the Barulas clan was led by the learned Barula and the Todoin Barula. The son of Haraldai was called
the Budadu clan because he was like rice without a mother. The son of Hachiu was called Adarkhidai. He
became the Adarkhin clan because he was a strong quarreler among his brothers. The son of Nachin the
hero was called Uruudai and Mangudai. He became the Uruud and Mangud clans. The two sons of
Shijuudai and Dogoldai, born from the noble Nachin's first wife, were divided into two groups.
47. The sons of Haidu were Baishinkhor Dogshin, Chirkhai Lianhua, and Chaujin Ortagai.
Baishinkhor Dogshin's son was Tumbinai Setsen. Chirkhai Lianhua's son was Sengun
Bilge, and Ambagaitan became the Taichung tribe. Chirkhai Lianhua took her concubine
as a wife and gave birth to a son. His name was Besudei. Besude became the tribe.
Chaujin Ortagai had six sons, whose names were: Oronar, Honhotan, Arulad, Sonid,
Habturkhas, and Geniges, so he became the tribe.
48. Habul Khan Samsechule, son of Tumbinai Setsen, and his two groups.
Samsechul's son Bultechu is a hero. Khabul Khan has seven sons, their names are
Ohinbarhag, Bartan Khaot, Hutugtu Monkhor, Hotala Khan, Hulan, Hadaan and
Todoin Otchigin.
49. The son of Ohinbarkha, Khutugtu, founded the Jurhi tribe. The son of Khutugtu, Khurahi,
founded the Seche-behi Taichu tribe. They became the Jurhi tribe.
50. The sons of Bartan the Great were Mengitu Khian, Negun Taiji, Yesukhei the Great, and Daridai
Otchigin. The son of Khutugtu Monkhor was Buri Bogo. At the time of their wedding in the thickets
of the Onon River, he cut off the shoulder of [Genghis's younger brother] Belgutai.
51. The sons of Hotala Khan were Zochi, Hirmau, and Altan. The son of Khulan Baatr
was Ikh Cheren. [Ikh Cheren's slave] Badai Khishlig and [during Genghis' reign]
became princes of Darkhad. Khadaan and Todoin both died childless.
52. Khabul Khan ruled all of Mongolia. When Khabul Khan had seven sons, he ordered that
Ambagai, the son of Sengun Bilgi, be made the king of all of Mongolia. 53. The Tatars of the
Ayrgud and Buirgud tribes lived on the Orshuun River, which connects the two lakes, Buir
Khulen. Ambagai Khan gave them his daughter, and he himself took the daughter and was
captured by the Tatars. The Tatars captured Ambagai Khan and sent him to the Golden Khan of
China. A man named Balkhachi from the Besud tribe was sent as an envoy by Ambagai Khan,
who said: "Go and tell Hotala, one of the seven sons of Khabul Khan, and Hadaan Taiji, one of
my ten sons. Please forbid me from sending my daughter away, even though you are the king
and the ruler of the country! I have been captured in the Tatar province. Try to avenge me until
the nails of five fingers are torn off and ten fingers are cut off."
54. At that time, while Yesuhei was hunting birds, he met a man named Ikh Chiledu of
Mergid who was returning from the Olkhun province with medicine. He saw his wife and
saw that she was a beautiful dog. Yesuhei rode home, took his brother Negun Taiji and his
younger brother Daridai Otchigin with him, and overtook Ikh Chiledu.
55. He was so frightened that he whipped his horse's thigh and ran away from the
mountainside. When the three of them chased him, he ran away even more, and when he
came around a hillock, he turned around and reached his chariot. When the queen, Oelun Ujin
(the Chinese word for queen) said: "Do you know what happened to those three people? Their
faces are suspicious. They can harm your life. If you stay alive, you will not have any trouble
finding a wife. There are girls in every village. There are queens in every chariot. [A.to] If you
miss me, name the wife you take after me. Now take care of your life. Smell my scent." He said
and took off his shirt. As soon as the great Chiledu took off the shirt from the horse, he saw
that the other three were also running around the hillock, and he was afraid. Chiledu, a quick-
witted horse, whipped his hips and rushed towards the Onon River.
56. The three of them chased him and chased him for seven passes, then they took Oelun
Ujin, led by Yesukhei Baatar, led by his elder brother Neguun Taiji, and followed by his
younger brother Daridai Otchigin [camel-riding A.to]. To this Oelun Ujin said:
"My man Chiledu,
In the cool wind
Blowing out her frizzy hair
Steppe countryside
Why bother with starving yourself?
"Now, what am I going to do with my two curly hairs hanging back and forth?"
"Onon cried so loudly that the river rippled and the forest shook, that
Daridai the fireman spoke from the side:
"Your beloved man has
crossed the threshold.
The man who remembered you in
tears has drowned many waters.
Even if you cry
I won't look at you,
Search and find
The gate and the path are not
found. [Three rivers redeemed
Three wins, three losses
No trace when searching.
It's not enough to see.
If you choose, you won't hear it.
Ch.Ts] He urged me to be quiet.
The hero Yesuhei then brought Oelun Ujin home and made her his wife. This is the
tradition of how the hero Yesuhei brought Oelun Ujin.
57. After Ambagai Khan was captured and Khadaan and Hotala were named, all the Mongols
and Thais gathered at a place called the Khorkhuna Valley on the Onon River, discussed it, and
made Hotala the king. The joy of the Mongols was dancing and weddings. They crowned Hotala
the king and shaved the ribs and knees under the Khorkhuna tree.
They danced until the ground was bare and they got married.
58. Both Hotala, the Khan and Khadaan Taijitay set out to take revenge on the
Tatars. They fought thirteen battles with the Tatars Khotan Baik and Jali Bukha, but
they could not fully avenge the Khan Ambagai.
59. At that time, when Yesukhei Baatar, the Tatar Temujin-uge, and the Tatar Hori-bukha were
captured by the Tatars, Oelun-uge, who was pregnant, gave birth to Genghis Khan at a place called
Deluun Kuldag on Onon. When Genghis was born, he was born with a lump the size of an ankle in his
right hand. He was given the name Temujin because he was born when he was captured by the Tatar
Temujin-uge.
60. From the wife of the hero Yesukhei, four sons were born: Temujin, Khasar, Khachiun,
and Temuge. Also, a daughter was born named Temuge. [Two groups of Begter Belgu,
born to the other wife of the hero Yesukhei, Sochigel. A.to] When Temuge was nine years
old, Zochi-Hasar was seven, Khachiun alchi was five, and Temuge otchigin (otgon means
king of fire, owner of the hearth) was three, and Temuge was in the cradle.
61. When Temujin was nine years old, the hero Yesukhei took Temujin away,
asking his uncles to marry him. On the way, he met Dey Setsen of Hongirad at
a place called Tsegtser Chikhurgu.
62. The king asked: "Where is Yesuhei going?" Yesuhei the hero said: "My
son's uncle is going to ask for a daughter from the people of Olhunou." The
king asked: "This boy is a boy with fire in his eyes and light in his face.
63. Yesuhei Khud, I had a dream last night. A white falcon flew in, holding the sun and the
moon, and landed on my hand. We see the sun and the moon with our own eyes. However,
I told others that it was amazing and a good thing for a falcon to hold the sun and the
moon and land on my hand. Yesuhei Khud, the fact that you brought a boy with you
immediately became the interpretation of my dream. What a dream! The herald of your
Hiad Aimag came and signaled me in a dream.
64. In our country, there is no longer any struggle to seize other people's land and people.
Don't invade foreign
countries, girls.
Put the horse in the cart.
The black hole is falling.
Go away, get angry.
You who have become kings, have been
promoted to the Queen's seat.
Let's sit together.
Don't fight other
citizens, girls.
Sitting in a carriage with a saddle (seat)
and riding a horse
Create and go
High base occupants
Will make a roommate.
Our country already has beautiful ladies and beautiful girls, so we will go with the color of
our nieces and the color of our daughters.
65. The children of the meadow will possess their land. The girls will be
transformed. Yesuhei, come to my house. I have a little girl. Look," said
Dey, and took Yesuhei home.
66. When Yesuhei Khud saw the girl, he fell in love with her, for she had a radiant face and a fiery
eye. Her name was Borte. She was ten years older than Temujin, a year older.
When he spent the night at Dey Setsen's house and asked for the girl the next day, Dey Setsen
said: "It is said that if you beg many times, you will be honored, and if you beg few times, you
will be humiliated, but since a girl's fate is not to grow old at the door of her birth, I will give
her to you. You make your son your son-in-law and keep him in our house." Yesukhei said: "I
will leave my son. My son is more fearful than a dog. Dear sir, do not let my son be frightened
by a dog!" He gave the horse he was leading a gift, left Temujin, and Yesukhei returned.
67. While Yesukhei was riding on the yellow side of Tsegtser, he happened to see a Tatar citizen getting
married, and he went down to the wedding because he was thirsty. The Tatars recognized Yesukhei, said,
"The honorable Yesukhei has arrived," and invited him to the wedding. They remembered the previous
revenge, discussed it in secret, and poisoned his food. Yesukhei fell ill on the way from there, and it took
him three days to reach home.
68. Yesukhei said: "I am sick. Who is near me?" When he asked, he said that the
son of the old man Chirkha of the khanate, Menlig (Menlig or Munlig), was near,
he called him and said: "Listen, my son, Menlig. My son is young. Temujin left the
boy in the womb and died of typhus on the way back. I am sick. You know how to
take care of your orphaned brothers and your widowed sister. Temujin, go and
bring the boy immediately! My beloved Menlig!" and he died of old age.
THE AGE OF GENGHIS
69. Menlig, following the words of the hero Yesukhei, went to Dey Setzen and said: "Brother
Yesukhei, I have come to take Temujin because I have been dreaming of him so much and have
felt sorry for him." Dey Setzen said: "I will send my son away if he dreams of me. But I must send
the gerdeg soon." Hearing these words, Menlig brought his father Temujin. [When the hero
Yesukhei became a sky, Temujin fell to the ground and groaned greatly, but Chirkha, the khan,
revived him and persuaded him, saying:
"Why do you lament
like a fish, Tulbarin?"
Didn't you discuss your plans with Tuyl to
strengthen your Tuurga (serpent) army?
Why do you cry like
a fish in water?
"Didn't you discuss your words with Ukir about
establishing your own politics?"
When he said that, he stopped crying. A.to]
70. That spring, Ambagai Khan's queen Orbai Sokha and two other people (the sons of the (burial
place) When the funeral meal was offered, Oelun Ujin won, so the funeral meal was held. The meal was
delayed. Orbai and Sokhatai were told by Oelun Ujin: "Yesuhei the hero is dead, my son is a child,
and the gift of the great story is How did you win over the Sarkhed with alcohol? You won't give it to me
even if you see me, and you won't tell me when you move, will you?" said.
71. To that word, Orbai and Sokha, the two queens, replied:
"You shouldn't be invited,
you should eat it! You
shouldn't be brought, you
should eat it!"
When King Ambagai died, this is what was said to Oelun.
72. "Let's leave the mother and sons of the Argatsaan people behind and move on. Don't take them with us."
The next day, the Thais Targudai-Khiriltug and Todoin-Girte set off for the Onon River. When Oelun Ujin and
his sons were left behind, the old man Chirkha of the Honkhotan went to persuade the movers, and Todoin-
Girte said, "The water of the Tseel has dried up, the Tsegeen stone has cracked."
"Ignoring the old man's words, Chirkha moved on. "Is that how you persuade him?" he said,
stabbing the old man in the back with his spear.
73. When the old man Chirkha came home wounded and lay in bed, Temujin went to see
him. The old man Chirkha of Honhotan told Temujin: "I went to persuade the people of
your good father to disperse and move, and I was stabbed like this," Temujin cried.
Oelun Ujin personally rode with a banner and brought back some of the citizens who had left and
moved away. However, the citizens who returned also did not settle down and moved away after
the Thais.
74. Thus, the Thais abandoned the young woman, whom the brothers had betrothed, and moved to
the countryside with her little sons.
Oelun, the mother of the wise, wore
the embroidered robe, girded herself
with the Ogotor skirt, and went up
and down the Onon River, gathering
the Olirs Moil.
She spent her days and nights
lovingly nurturing her little sons.
A capable mother
Carrying the oak tree, she went up and down the
Tsavchim land, digging up the roots of the Sod-
hichgen, spending the night and day in the
fields, feeding and raising her sons. [The
Queen's Mother, the Mother of the Queen]
Carrying a melted shor, they went down
the Khaldun mountain and dug up the
Hawiin mangir. The kings lovingly fed
their sons and raised them until they
were full. A.to]
75. The beautiful mother, Goh, went up and
down the river with a hook, and the Gogod
mangir went with her, and the prince raised
her sons. The sons, whom the mother,
Zatgas, who was born with principles, raised
with potatoes, grew up to become
governors and ministers.
The sons of the beautiful mother Gogo, who
was raised by the mangyar, grew up to be noble
ministers. The sons of the mother Ujin, who was
raised by the mangyar, grew up to be noble
ministers. They became powerful and powerful.
They sat on the banks of the mother Onon,
threw the fish into the water, and caught the
fish. They fed the mother Ujin. The sons of the
principled woman, who was raised by the
mangyar, grew up to be powerful men. They fed
the seaweed-laden water, and caught the fish,
and fed their mother Zayaat.
76. One day, Temujin, Khasar, Begter, and Belgutai were sitting together, fishing, and
a bright yellow fish caught in the fish. Temujin and Khasar and Begter Belgutai
snatched the fish from him. Temujin and Khasar came home and told their mother, "A
bright yellow fish caught in the fish, and both Begter and Belgutai snatched it." Their
mother said, "Why are you two sons of the same father arguing like this? You know
that now you have no husband but your shadow, and no whip but your tail. How can
we take revenge on the Thais? Why are you not like the five sons of the old Alun
mother? Don't do that."
77. From there, Temujin and Khasar said indifferently: "Yesterday, they took away a lark that
they shot and killed. Today, they took it again. How can I live with you like this?" They said
and stormed out of the house. Begter, who was sitting on the hill, herding nine yellow
horses, secretly aimed his arrows at Temujin from behind and Khasar from in front. Begter
saw them and said: "When the Tais have been waiting for the death of their brothers and
have not been able to complete their revenge, how can you make me an eyelash and a
mouthful of vomit? Now I have no husband but a shadow, no other than a tail.
"Why are you doing this when you don't have a whip? Don't cover my fire. Don't
kill Belgutey," he said, sitting cross-legged and acquiescing. Temujin shot Khasar
from behind and killed him.
78. When Temujin and Khasar entered the house, the mother of Temujin saw the faces
of her son and immediately knew the reason and said:
"The foreigners are dying."

"When you have suffered the harm of the Thais and how can you take revenge? Why did you
do this?" he said, quoting an ancient saying and using the words of the elders as a basis, he
severely criticized his sons.
79. Meanwhile, Targudai Hiriltug of the Thais, accompanied by his companions, came to attack, saying, "The
hair of the lamb has grown, and the body of the tula has grown strong" (the sons of Oelun have become
strong).
Fearing them, Oelun Ujin and his sons hid in the forest. Belgut broke a tree and made a
shield. Khasar fought with arrows and hid Khachiun, Temuge, and Temulun in a
mountain cave, when the Tais shouted: "Brother Temujin, bring him out. The others are
not needed," and they secretly hid Temujin in the forest. When the Tais learned of this,
they chased him away, and Temujin slipped into the forest of Terguun Oder, but the Tais
could not penetrate and surrounded him.
80. Temujin, after three days in the forest, led his horse, saying, "Let's see now," when the
saddle fell off his horse. When he looked back, the saddle was still in place when it came off.
"The saddle can come off, but how can the saddle come off? Is the sky persuading?" he thought,
and waited another three days. When he went out again, the way out of the forest was blocked
by a white stone the size of a house. "Is the sky persuading?" he thought, and went back for
another three days. After nine days without food, he said, "Let's go out to die like this." He cut
down a tree with his arrow (arrow-making) knife that was blocking the way around the white
stone the size of a house that had fallen and led his horse out. As soon as the Thais met him,
they caught him.
81. Temujin was captured by Targudai-Khiriltu, brought to his country, punished, and
sent to each family for a night. On the sixteenth day of the first month of summer, the
Tai people were married on the banks of the Onon River, and the sun set. At that
wedding, a simple boy was brought to guard Temujin. As soon as the wedding party
dispersed, the simple boy hit the head of the boy with his wrist (fist) once and ran to
the water's edge (still water next to the stream) to see if he would be seen. He lay down
on his back and floated down to the water, his face exposed.
82. When the guard shouted loudly, "The captured man has been lost," the scattered Tais
gathered and, on a clear night as clear as day, they all searched the Onon grove. Sorkhon-
shar, who had just happened to see Temujin lying in the water, said: [There is no trace of
him in the water, no trace of him in the sky, so it is right for you to lie like this. A.to] "You
have such a way and such a person with fire in your eyes and light on your face, so the Tais
will envy you. You lie like this. I will not teach you," and he passed by. When the Tais
advised them how to search further, Sorkhon-shar said: "Let us go back along the path we
have taken and examine the surrounding area again." They all agreed, "Okay," and
everyone went on their way. And Sorkhon-shar attacked Temujin and said, "Brothers, the
Taichungs are walking in fear, their mouths and teeth are gnashing. You lie down firmly,"
and passed by.
83. When the Thais did not find him, they consulted about going back to search again.
Sorkhon-shar said: "Thais, [Lord A.to]'s sons, we have lost everyone in broad daylight, and
now how can we find them in the dark of night? Let us each search again along the same
path we took and gather tomorrow to search. Where will that man with chains go?"
Everyone said, "Yes," and they went back to search.
Sorkhon-shar also came to Temujin and said: "Now we have to search once and then
tomorrow. As soon as we have dispersed, go to your mother and brothers. If anyone comes
across you, do not say that you saw me." He left.
84. As soon as they had dispersed, Temujin thought to himself: "If I spend a few
days in the house of Sorkhon-shar, his son Chimbai Chuluun and I will
"Please take pity on me and let me stay overnight, freeing my chains at night. Now Sorkhon-shar
has passed by without seeing me or teaching me. They will save me," he said, heading towards
Sorkhon-shar's house and heading towards the Onon River.
85. The sign of Sorkhon-shar's house was to keep churning milk and honey (airag) until dawn.
Following that sign, heading towards the sound of the churn and entering his house, Sorkhon-
shar said: "I did not tell you to go to your mother and brothers. What have you come for?" His
sons Chimbai and Chuluun said: "If a bird, lacking a watch, takes refuge in a bush, the bush will
protect it and save it. Now, how can you say that when a person comes to us for shelter?" They
condemned their father, broke the hut and burned it in the fire, and sent Temujin to the
northern black (mukhlag) chariot, saying, "Do not tell the animal man," and gave him a daughter
named Khadaan to look after. 86. The third day [Where can a bound person go far away? A.to]
"Our people must have hidden him. Let's search the houses in the meantime," he said,
searching each house and then came to Sorkhon-shar, searching even under the ger cart and
the iser (bed), then he went to the northern ungast cart, pulled the ungast at the mouth, and
when he reached Temujin's feet, Sorkhon-shar said: "How can a person live in an ungast in such
a hot weather? [He was so angry. A.to] ", the searchers got off and left.
87. After the search was over, Sorkhon-shar said to Temujin: "You have deceived
me. Go immediately to your mother and brothers." He mounted a white-
breasted mare, cooked a lamb, gave it a drinking bowl, a bow, and two arrows,
and sent it away without a saddle or a bridle.
88. From there, Temujin went to the place he had previously visited, followed the grassy path up the
Onon River, and reached the Himurga stream flowing from the east. He ascended the Himurga
stream and reached a place called Khorcukhui in the Beder district, where he met his mother and
brothers.
89. There, they all gathered together and settled in a place called Khokh Nuur, the Black Heart of the
Sengur River (Tsenkheri River), which flows into the Khurelkh, in the lap of Burkhan Khaldun, and lived
by killing and eating marmots and ants.
90. One day, eight yellow ags near the house were robbed by robbers, and Temujin
and his men watched on foot. Belgutei rode his beloved horse and went to hunt
marmots. After the sun had set, the beloved horse loaded the marmots on his horse
until they were too heavy to carry and led them on foot. When Belgutei heard that the
yellow ags had been robbed, he said, "I will ask." Khasar said, "You cannot, I will ask."
Temujin said: "You can't do it, I will ask you." He rode the horse and chased the yellow
horse through the grassy meadows for three days. One morning, when he came across
many horses, he saw a young boy milking a mare. When he met him and asked the
yellow horse, the boy said: "This morning, before sunrise, eight yellow horses were
driven out with this one. I will teach you the way." He put the horse down and put the
horse on Temujin. He quickly rode the horse, and without returning home, he put it on
a saddle and tied it up in the field. Then he said: "My husband, you are very sad. You
have the same troubles as a man. I will be your husband. My father is Nahu Bayan. I
am his only son. My name is Boorchi." They both rode and followed the yellow horses
for three days. One evening, when the sun was shining brightly, they reached a village,
and eight yellow horses were eating grass on the outskirts of the village. Temujin said:
"My husband, stay here.
"That's our yellow horse. I'll chase him," Boorchi said, "How can I stay here
as your husband?" They both charged together and chased the yellow
horses away.
91. Many people from the north chased him. Among them, a man on a white horse [with a
red cloak. A.to] caught up with him alone, holding a bow and arrow. Boorchi said: "My
friend, give me your bow and arrow. I will shoot." Temujin said: "You shoot for me. I will
shoot." He turned and shot. When the man on the white horse kept on begging, his
companions from the north caught up with him in a large group, but the sun had already
set and it was already dark, so they could not catch up. 92. Temujin and Boorchi took their
horses and rode all night, and after three days and three nights, they approached Boorchi's
house. Temujin said: "How can I get this horse without you? [How much will I get? A.to]
How much will you get?" Boorchi said: "I, my good friend, have gone to help you, thinking
that you are going to be sad. "I am not looking for any loot. I am the only son of the wealthy
Nahu, so the wealth my father has accumulated will be mine in abundance," he said.
93. When they both reached the house of the rich man Nahu, who was in tears because he had lost
his son, he saw his son coming and started crying and scolding him. When he asked, "Tell me what
happened, my son," Boorchi said, "I saw this good man walking in sorrow and went with him. Now
he has come," and he rode and brought a saddle that had been tied to the field. They killed a lamb
and prepared food for Temujin, and also gave him a saddle of scythes. Nahu said, "From now on, the
two young men will be good friends and never leave each other." From there, Temujin rode and
traveled for three days and three nights until he reached his home at the Sengur stream. When
Temujin arrived, the worries of Oelun, Hasar, and his brothers were relieved and they were happy.
94. Temujin had not seen Borte Ujin since he had visited him when he was nine years
old. Now Temujin and Belgu went to the Kherlen River to look for Borte Ujin. Between
Tsegtser and Chikhurgu, Dei Setsen of Hongirad lived. Dei Setsen was very happy to
see Temujin and said: "I know that the Tai brothers are jealous of you, so I have been
worried and desperate about you. Now I have met you." He gave Borte Ujin to
Temujin. Temujin took Borte Ujin and returned with him. Dei Setsen followed him
and reached a place called the Urag Desert in Kherlen [A.to., tired from the heat] and
returned to Kherlen. The wife of the king, Tsotan, saw the daughter of Borte Ujin and
brought her to the Sengur stream in the Khurelkh.
95. Tsotang replied and sent Belgutai to invite Boorchi to be his friend. When Belgutai arrived,
Boorchi, without telling his father, mounted his hunchbacked horse, hunched over his brown horse
(hevneg), and went with Belgutai. That was the custom of Boorchi's friendship with Temujin.
96. When Temujin moved from the Sengur River and settled on the banks of
the Kherlen River, they took the black sable ox that Tsotan had brought as a
shitgul (coat) and went with Temujin, Hasar, and Belgutei to meet the old
close friend (husband) of Yesukhei's father, Van Khan. When Van Khan was
living in the thickets of the Tuul River, Temujin said: "You are my father's old
friend, and I have brought you a black sable ox with a coat." He gave the
sable ox to Van Khan, saying:
"In return for your blackness,
your divided country
Let's get together.
In return for your Bulgan,
your shattered country
Let's collect it.
"May the kidneys be in the buttocks,
and the phlegm be in the chest (May
the brother be well-mannered)."
97. From there, the old man Uriankhain Jarchiudai, who had settled on the banks of the Bulgan
River, took his old blacksmith's bellows (a blacksmith's bellows) and brought his son named
Zelme with him and said: "Temujin, the chief of the Onon, gave you the Bulgan cradle when you
were born, and I gave you this son Zelme, but I took him home because he was still a baby. Now
you are my son Zelme."
Saddle up.
"Open the door," he said.
98. While living on the banks of the Kherlen River, the mother of the Burgi
River, one morning, as dawn broke, the maidservant of the house of the
mother
99. Mother Oelun said, "Wake up the sons immediately," and she immediately got up. Temujin
immediately got up and held their horses. Temujin, Oelun, Khasar, Khachiun, Temuge Otchigin,
Belgutei, Boorchi, and Zelme each rode a horse, and Mother Oelun carried Temujin in her arms. She
loaded one horse with things and led him away. Boerte Ujin lacked a horse.
100. Temujin's brothers rode and set off towards the Burkhan Khaldun at dawn. The elder
Huagchin, intending to hide the elder Burte, put them in a cart with a cabin [A.to loaded his
goods and sat in the cart], loaded a pair of oxen, and set off towards the Tunkheleg stream [A.to
reached the Tunkheleg stream that gave him the mountain], and just as dawn broke, soldiers
came towards him and asked, "What kind of person are you?" The elder Huagchin said: "I am
Temujin's servant. I have come to shear sheep in the great house. Now [A.to, carrying the young]
is going home." The soldiers asked: "Is Temujin at home? Is he not? Where is his home?" The
elder Huagchin said: "His home is nearby. I do not know whether Temujin is there or not, I have
come from the northern house."
101. The soldiers left in droves. The old woman, the old woman, and her fat oxen, were hurrying
to leave when the axle of the cart broke. Because the axle was broken, they were about to enter
the forest on foot. When the soldiers came from behind, they dragged Belgutai's mother, her legs
broken, and they asked, "What is in this cart?" The old woman, the old woman, said, "There is a
donkey." The leader of the soldiers said, "Brothers, get out and see." The others got out and
opened the door of the closed cart, and there was the queen sitting inside. He dragged her out of
the cart, and the old woman, the old woman, dragged both of them, and followed Temujin
through the grassy fields, and Burkhan Khaldun went up.
102. Burkhan Khaldun searched for Temujin and did not find him. He went back
and forth, but he could not find Temujin because of the mud that was deep, the
dense forest, and the thickets full of snakes. The soldiers who attacked were three
Mergids. Uduyd Mergid's Togtoa, Uvas (Ukhaa) Mergid's Dayr-
The three of them, the King of Usun, the King of Khaad Mergid, and the King of Dharmala, had come to
seek revenge for the abduction of their mother, Oelun, from Chileun. Now, those Mergids said, "We came
to avenge the abduction of Oelun, but now the mother has abducted us. We have avenged our ancestors."
They returned home.
103. [They took Borte Ujin and gave him to Chiledu's younger brother Chiledu. A.to] Temujin:
"Will those three Mergids return home? Will they hide in the mountains? Follow them for
three days and find out," he sent Belgutey, Boorchi, and Zelme. Temujin himself descended to
Burkhan Khaldun, spread his chest (beat it), and prayed, saying:
"Listen like a rainbow"

He hung his belt around his neck like a garland, his hat dangling in his hand, his hand pressed to his chest,
turned towards the sun, and bowed to the God of the Nine, bowing and shaking his head.
GENGHIS KHAN'S WORDS AND TEMUGHIN'S WORDS
THE EXTENSION
104. From there, Temujin, Khasar, and Belgut went to Khan Tooril, who lived in
the Black Forest on the Tuul River, and said: "While I was unaware, three
marauders attacked and kidnapped my wife and children. My father Khan came
to ask me to save my wife and children." Khan Tooril replied: "Didn't I tell you
years ago? I told you this about the sbulan dach who brought me a father like a
father.
"In return for your bulgan,
your shattered country
Let's make it bigger.
In return for your black and white, we will
unite your divided country. Keep your
pride in your chest.
Keep your kidneys in check.
(May the brother have a market)"
He said.
Now he has fulfilled his word, and in
response to your words, Bulgan, all
the wise men
Attack with a cover
Your hair is beautiful.
Let's give it back.
The answer to your black and white lies
is all the more painful.
Hit the hammer
Your Queen Bertie
Let's get it answered.
"You tell Jamuha brother. Jamuha brother, there is a place called Khorkhuna Jubur. I will take
two thousand soldiers from here and ride on the right. Jamuha brother, take two thousand
soldiers and ride on the left. Let Jamuha fix the date for our meeting."
105. Temujin, Khasar, and Belgutei, all three, separated from Tooril Khan and returned
home. Temujin and Jamukh sent Khasar and Belgutei to tell them:
"Come to the east,
My stomach hurts.
My stomach is empty.
To be a support
Please, you kind
people, take revenge.
My dear heart.
It's getting worse.
"My dear friends,
please accept this gift."
He also conveyed the words of Tooril Khan of Hereid to Jamukha: "Remembering that we went
in unity with our father Khan Yesukhei in the past, let us now take two thousand soldiers and
march on the right. Let Jamukha, the younger brother, take two thousand soldiers and march
on the left. Let Jamukha know the date of our meeting." After hearing these words, Jamukha
said:
"Today, friend Temujin
In this suffering
I felt sick after hearing about
the loss.
I apologize.
Liver failure
I will mourn.
This is asking for revenge.
These provinces
Fall apart
Wife Bert
Let's bring it back.
All the kings and queens
Hit the hammer
Queen Bertha
Please answer.
The sound of the rolling hills
The sound of the war

It's not anywhere. In the

The evil of the wicked, the

They broke into the house and
attacked the whole family.
Let's capture the colorful eggs, take
away the eggs that are inside, and cut
off the seeds that are growing, and
take our revenge!
The king's noble idol was torn
apart by the sword.
Let's make it a joke!
"Let's attack until the city and the
great country are empty."
106. Jamuha also told Temujin and Tooril Khan: "Now I
The flag is very visible (visible from afar) and
covered with black bull skin.
The Queen, wielding her sword, unleashed her
fiercely-sounding tambourine.
Wearing his Khalkh armor,
aiming his rusty arrow
Riding my black horse, leading my
entire army, I set out to attack the
wise kings and fight fiercely. I
bowed down to my beautiful
banner, I spread my cowhide
turban, I always wore my armor, I
held my sharp sword in my hand.
Truly, with his wise aim, Ulemj rode his
good horse, led his numerous troops,
and set out to fight to the death
against the wicked and wicked citizens
of Uheen.
"Tooril Khan, ride on, attack Temujin anda through Burkhan Khaldun's lap, and come to a
place called Botokhan-boorji, the source of the Onon River. I will take a thousand soldiers
from here and on the way, I will take another thousand soldiers from Temujin anda's
subjects who live on the Onon River, and together we will go to Botokhan-boorji, making
two thousand soldiers."
107. Jamukha heard these words from Khasar Belgutei and Temujin and conveyed them to
Tooril Khan. When Tooril Khan heard Jamukha's words, he took two thousand soldiers and
rode towards the Burkhan Khaldun's Burgi bank. When Temujin heard this, he left the Burgi
bank and moved towards the Tunkheleg Burkhan Khaldun's Burgi bank and landed at the
Tana stream. Tooril Khan, with a thousand soldiers, and Tooril Khan's brother Jaha Khambu,
with a thousand soldiers, landed at Ail Khargana on the Himurga stream, where Temujin took
his army and landed together.
108. Temujin, Tooril Khan, and Jakha Khambu set out together and arrived at the place
called Botokhan-boorji, the mother of Onon. Jamukha arrived there and waited for
three days. Temujin, Tooril, and Jakha Khambu also assembled their troops and met.
Jamukha said: "Didn't you swear in Mongolian that you will not miss the meeting if it
rains, and that you will not delay the meeting if it rains? Didn't you mean that the one
who loses after saying "yes" would be eliminated from the group?" Toril Khan said:
"Jamukha, my brother, know that you will be punished for being three days late from
the appointed date." This is how they discussed the matter of missing the date.
109. They set out from Botokhan-Boorji, reached the Khilgo River, tied a raft, and went to a
place called Buur-Kheer, where they attacked the household of Togtoa Bekh, destroyed his
sacred idols, and captured his wife. The Khutagt amulet was attacked by a wolf, and his village
was devastated. They could have attacked Togtoa Bekh while he was sleeping. However, the
fishermen, sable hunters, and hunters living on the Khilgo River sent a message to Togtoa Bekh
that night, saying, "The enemy is afraid." Hearing this news, Togtoa and Dayr Usun of Uvas
Mergid, together with a few companions, went down the Selenga and disappeared into the
Bargujin country.
110. The Mergids fled and that night, when they were crossing the Selenga, our soldiers
attacked and robbed the fleeing Mergids. Temujin called out among the fleeing people,
"Borte Borte," and went in search of them. Borte Ujin, who was among the fleeing people,
heard Temujin's voice and recognized him. He got out of the chariot and ran with the
woman Huagchin, and grabbed Temujin's reins. When Temujin saw Borte Ujin in the night,
he met him in his arms. That same night, Temujin sent a message to Tooril Khan and
Jamuha, saying: "We have found the person we are looking for, so let's stop attacking here
tonight." The fleeing Mergids stayed where they reached that night. Borte Ujin escaped
from the Mergids and met Temujin in this way.
111. In the past, Togtoa Behi of Uduyd Mergid, Dayr-Usun of Uvas Mergid, and Dharmala of
Khaad Mergid, along with three hundred men, set out one morning to avenge the abduction of
Oelun, the wife of Ikh Chiledu, the younger brother of Togtoa Behi, by Yesukhei Batar. At that
time, Temujin was missing from Burkhan Khaldun, and he searched three times, but he could
not find Temujin. However, Borte Ujin was captured and given to Chiledu's younger brother
Chileger Baq and raised. Since then, Borte Ujin has been living in Chileger Baq's house. Now
Chileger Baq is missing, and he regrets it and says:
"Black and evil crow"
When I was destined to eat bark, I
decided to eat the Black Goose.
Like fighting.
I am a bad boy who doesn't
answer, but I miss you a lot.
Attack on the queen
All citizens
Khalkh is left without shelter due
to the threat of infection
Fleeing in the dark night, he took
refuge in the cleft of the rock.
To die for love
The evil bird, about to lose
its black head,
The mouse was destined to eat the mouse, but the swan
decided to eat the goose.
Like losing your head
I am the evil Chileger, the
queen of the Ujin Dynasty.
I copied it.
In the city, many people
It caused harm.
I am a bad,
Without a place to hide, the only
thing left to do is to live in fear.
No place to take care of
"Shall I crawl into the dark
abyss, or through the rocks?
Where will I go?"
He said he was missing.
112. The king brought Dharmala, put her in chains, and sent her to the Khaldun mountain. Belgutei, hearing
that Belgutei's mother was in that house, went to get his mother and entered the right door of the house.
His mother was wearing a shaggy sheepskin coat and came out the left door of the house and said to the
people outside:
"My dear sons,
When I reached the rank of king,
but here I am
To the evil eyed person
It belongs to you.
The faces of the princes
"What can I see?"
He ran into the deep forest and searched for her but could not find her. If he saw a Belgutei prince
or a Mergid tribe member, he would shoot and say, "Bring my mother." Burkhan Khaldun killed
three hundred Mergids who had attacked Temujin and his men.
Even the seeds of the seed
The ashes are scattered by the wind.
The remaining children
As a doorman
Some of the beautiful ones were
taken as friends forever.
113. Temujin admired Tooril Khan and Jamuha and said:
"Father Khan Tooril"
Dear friends,
Jamukha, join forces.
By the grace of heaven, by the
grace of the Mother Earth
Ancient vengeful spirits
The liver heals the heart.
Destroy the noble species
Emptying the house of possession
"We captured many things."
Having thus entertained the wise citizen, he returned.
114. After the Uduyd Mergids fled, our soldiers found a five-year-old boy named
Hüqu, who had a sable hat, deerskin boots, a sable khöömii robe, a sable eye,
and a freckle on his face, and gave it to Mother Öelun as a gift.
115. Temujin, Tooril Khan, and Jamuha together
Destroying the homes of many women and
capturing the noble women
Orkhon and Selenge
Returned from the forest.
Leaving Talhun Island, Temujin and Jamuha headed towards Khorkhunag Jubur. Tooril
Khan and Burkhan Khaldun crossed the Ukhort forest along the ridge, attacked the
Gatsuurt (Gatsuurtai) forest and Uliat (Uliastai) forest, and after hunting, returned to the
Tuulgol Black Forest.
116. Temujin and Jamuha met in the valley of Khorkhuna, and they talked about their
old friendship, and decided to become closer and closer. When they first became
friends, Temujin was eleven years old. At that time, Jamuha gave Temujin a gur anklet,
and Temujin gave Jamuha a cast anklet, and they became friends by tying them on the
ice of Onon. When he was shooting with his bow in the north, Jamuha gave Temujin a
sounding arrow made by tying two horns of a buffalo, and Temujin gave Jamuha his
juniper-wood arrow and became friends. This is how they became friends twice.
117. If you listen to the words of Ahaz, everyone will be able to
communicate with each other.
If only we could be friends.
In your body
It's a shame.
In both
As a gift
You should marry me.
Now let's win together.
Temujin said, and gave Jamukha the golden belt he had captured from Togtoa of Mergid,
and gave Togtoa's felt (ermeg or agsam) otter to Jamukha. Jamukha responded by giving
Temujin the golden belt he had captured from Dayr-Usun of Uvas Mergid, and gave
Temujin the white horse that had been harnessed to Dayr-Usun's horns. Thus they
became friends.
In the valley of Jubur, in the lap of the
hunchback Khuldgar
Under the birch tree
Have a beautiful wedding.
Dancing and having fun
Together, my heart and soul
Be good friends.
At night, we will sleep under a blanket.
118. Temujin and Jamukha had a long and happy life together, and one day they decided to
leave that land, and they did so on the sixteenth day of the first month of summer, the red
full moon. As Temujin and Jamukha were walking in front of the chariots, Jamukha spoke to
them.
"Friend Temujin!
Let's go down the mountain.
May the horseman have a home!
[Oh, right? A.to] Let's go
down to the middle.
To the shepherd and the lambs
Let there be food!
[Isn't it forbidden? A.to] said.
(It seems to mean that half of them will go down to the mountains, half of them will go down to the rivers, half of
them will go down to the pastures of the sheep.) Temujin, hearing Jamukh's words, did not say anything in
response, but waited for the nomadic caravan and said to his mother, Oelun:
"Friend Jamukha said to me: Let's
hurry down the mountain,
May the horseman have a home!
Oh, right?
Let's get down to the middle,
To the shepherd and the lambs
Let there be food!
Isn't it forbidden?
"I said. I didn't say anything in response to this. I came to ask my mother."
Before my mother could say anything, Börte said, "They say that Jamuha gets
bored easily. Now is the time for him to get bored with us. What Jamuha said in
the flag (saya) is an example for us. We won't get down. Let's leave Jamuha and
continue on this journey all night."
119. Borte did not agree with Ujin's words and went all night, attacking the
Burut Thais. The Thais were afraid and set off at night towards Jamukh. Our
people found a little boy named Khokhochu who had been left behind in the
land of the Thais, and gave him to Mother Oelun to feed.
120. Temujin and his men traveled that night and when the day dawned, three brothers from the Jalair
province, Khachiun-Tohuraun, Kharkhai-Tohuraun, and Kharaldai-Tohuraun, moved that night.
came with them. The five brothers Hadaan and Daldurkhan from Darkhad province, and the sons of Mengitu
Khian, Ungur, accompanied by their changshiut and bawd subjects. The brothers Kublai and Hudus came
from Barulas province. The two brothers Jatai and Dogolhu Cherbi came from Mangud province. The younger
brother of Boorchi, Ugelen Cherbi, left Arulad province and joined his older brother Boorchi. The younger
brother of Zelmi, Chaurkhan, Subedei Baatar, left Uriankhai province and joined Zelme. The two brothers
Degei and Khugugur came from Besud province. The brothers Chilegutei-Tahi and Taichiudai came from
Suldus province. The two sons Setse-Domog and Arkhai-Hasar Bala from Jalair province came with their sons.
Suihetu Cherbi came from Honhotan. From Suhegen came Suhehei-Jaun, the son of Jegei Khondgar. From
Neudein came Tsagaan Goo. From Olhunoud aimag came Khingiadai, from Gorlos aimag Sechiur, and from
Durved aimag Mochi Budun. Butu from Ihires aimag, who was a groom here, came with them. Junso from
Noyokhon aimag came. From Oronar aimag came Surgaan. Then from Barulas aimag Soho Setsen and
Kharachar came with their sons. Also from Baarin aimag Khorchi, Usun Old Man, Khokhochos, and Menen
came with their baarings, forming a circle.
121. Khorchi came and said: "We are a people of one womb and one blood, and
we are related to Jamuha, because we were born of a female that Bodonchar
Bogd captured. Therefore, we cannot be separated from Jamuha. But the sky
showed me that a wise cow came and went around Jamuha, and after bowing
to Jamuha and his chariot, broke one of its horns and became a horn, and
began to grow
"May Temujin be the ruler of the country,"
Teyge said, "and I will lead him."
Thus, the heavenly light came to my eyes and showed me.
"Temujin, if you become the ruler of the country, how will you make me happy, since you have already
instructed me?" Temujin replied, "If I truly become the ruler of the country, I will make you the ruler of the
people." Khorchi replied, "What kind of happiness is it to make me the ruler of the people, since you have
already instructed me in such great matters of state? Make me the ruler of the people and grant me the
right to make thirty beautiful girls from all over the country into wives. And listen carefully to everything I
say!"
122. The Huns led by Geniges formed a circle, and Daridai Otchigin formed a circle. Mulhalhu of
Jadaran province came. Unjin Sahait formed a circle. Having thus departed from Jamukh, they set
out and landed at a place called Ail-Khargana on the Himurga stream. At that time, Sacha Behi
and Taichu, the sons of Sorkhatu-Jurkh of Jurkhin, also separated from Jamukh and formed a
circle, and Khuchar Behi, the son of Negun Taiji, formed a circle, and Altan Otchigin, the son of
Hotala Khan, formed a circle, and departed from Jamukh and joined Temujin when he landed at
Ail-Khargana on the Himurga stream. Temujin moved from there and landed at the Black Heart of
the Blue Lake on the Sengur stream in the Khurelkh.
123. Altan, Khuchar, and Sacha Behi all consulted together and said to Temujin: "We will
make you king. Temujin will make you king and we will make you king."
In many wars

Leave it alone.
In peacetime
Lord Temujin is yours.
Oh, the commandment.
If you don't follow
Take the occupied people
Women are stealing boys.
This body of mine
Deserted land
"Leave it alone."
Having said these words and thus lost his temper, Temujin was named Genghis Khan
and made Khan (Genghis Khan seems to mean Tengis Khan, Dalai Khan.)
124. Genghis Khan and the sons of Boorchi, Ugelen Cherbi, Khachiun-Tokhuraun, and the
brothers Jetei and Dogolhu, were four in number. Ongur, Suikhetu Cherbi, and Hadaan-
Daldurkhan, the three, said:
"Breakfast"
No accidents today.
Lunch
Forever and ever
"Let's do it," he said, so he was reduced to
(cook). He said:
"The beautiful spotted sheep
Grazing in abundance
Many flocks of sheep
The city is full of growth
I was born in a hut,
and I am a couple.
Eat meat from a pig.
Don't miss it every day.
Kill the best blade every
day without fail
"Let's prepare the spicy soup."
So Degey went to tend the sheep. His brother Khugugur said:
"A cart with a cart"
The little one
The axle cart, which is made to be
stable and not break down.
On the way there
Make sure you don't delay,
do the housework.
"Let's fix it."
Therefore, Khuguri was appointed as the charioteer. The wives, children, and servants in the
household were commanded by Dodai. Kublai, Chilgutai, and Kharkhai-Tokhuraun were
appointed to guard the Khasar's territory with swords:
"The power of the invaders
Neck pain
The great tribe
"Go ahead and cut the cord."
He said to Belgutei and Haraldai-Tohuraun: "Let them be hunters. Let them be hunters." He
said to Hutu, Morichi, and Mulhalhu of the Tais, "Let them be horsemen." He said to Arkhai
Hasar, Takhar, Suhekhai, and Chaurkhan, "Let them be the link between the regions and
the near regions." The hero Subedei said:
"Like a mouse, like a cat"
Like a black crow, guarding the
confiscated wealth
I'm sorry for everything.
Like a blanket to cover
A friend becomes a shield
Protecting the home
"Let's be careful."
125. From there, Genghis Khan, having become a khan, spoke to Boorchi Zelme:
"Other than the shadow
Without a husband
Become my shadow.
Different from the last one
Without a whip
It's my turn.
My soul is refreshed.
My dear friends, who have been
comforted by my thoughts.
"You two came before everyone else, so you will be the leaders of everyone else." Genghis
Khan also said: "May heaven forgive you, may earth bless you, and may you be the first of my
good friends to leave Jamukh and come to me to think of me and be my friend. Therefore, I
have appointed you to appropriate positions."
126. When Tooril Khan of the Kheriyds sent Tahai and Suhekhei to inform them that Genghis Khan
had been made Khan, Tooril Khan said: "My son, Temujin, it is very right that he has been made
Khan. How can the Mongols live without a Khan?"
I will not break this decision.
I will not break my bond.
I will not lose my motherland.
"Be polite."
JAMUHA AND THE FIGHT AGAINST THE TAYCHI
127. If Archai Khasar and Chaurkhan are sent as envoys to Jamuha, Jamuha
He said: "Go to Altan and Khuchar and tell them: Altan and Khuchar, why did
you separate Temujin and me by piercing his ribs and piercing his ribs? When
Temujin and I were together, you did not make him Khan, so what is your
intention now? Altan and Khuchar, keep your word, please comfort Temujin
and be a good friend to him."
128. After him, Taichar, the younger brother of Jamukh, who lived in the place called Ulgii
Bulag, in the lap of Jalama (mountain), went to rob the horses of our Jochi-Dharmala, who
was in the place called Saar-kheer. Taichar robbed Jochi-Dharmala's horses. When Jochi-
Dharmala's horses were robbed and his companions were discouraged, Jochi-Dharmala
himself went alone, and at night he reached the edge of the horse, lay down on his horse's
mane, shot Taichar in the back, killed him, and brought back his horse.
129. "Jamukha, having united his brother Taichar, led thirteen tribes of Jadaran, and led three
thousand soldiers, crossed the Alag and Turgag mountains, and attacked Genghis Khan," Mulkhe-
totag and Boroldai of the Ihires tribe told Genghis Khan while he was in Khurelkhed. Hearing this
news, Genghis Khan took three thousand soldiers from his thirteen circles and rode out to meet
Jamukha and fought at a place called Dalanbaljud. Genghis Khan was forced to retreat to the Zeeren
gorge on the Onon River. Jamukha said to this: "We have driven them into the Zeeren gorge on the
Onon River." On his way back, he boiled the young men of the Chinos tribe in a cauldron, cut off the
heads of the white-headed guava, and dragged them away on the back of his horse.
130. After Jamukh was defeated, the Jurchidei of Urud province and the Huildar of Mangud
province, accompanied by their subordinate provinces, left Jamukh and came to support Genghis
Khan. The father of Menlig of Honhotan, who had been following Jamukh, now left Jamukh and
accompanied by his seven sons, joined Genghis Khan. Rejoicing that Jamukh had separated from
his people and Genghis had come to his senses, Genghis Khan, Ölün üjin, Khasar, Sacha Behi of
Jurkhin, and Taichu gathered in the Onon grove and got married. Genghis Khan led the toast to
Ölün üjin, Khasar, and Sacha Behi. Then, when Sacha Behi's younger wife Ebehei led the toast,
Khorigin Khatan and Khuurchin Khatan became angry and said, "Why don't you lead us, why did
you start toasting Ebehei first?" They rebuked the cook Shikhur. Chef Shikhur was devastated and
cried loudly, "This is how it is because the hero Yesuhei and the great chief are no longer here."
131. Belgutei from our side arranged the wedding, holding the horse of Genghis Khan.
Buri-bokh from Zhurhin was arranging the wedding. However, a man from the
Khatagin tribe stole a tulbuur from the bridle of our horse and was caught. Buri-bokh
defended the man and quarreled with Belgutei. Belgutei would always fight, so he
would unbutton his right sleeve and show his bare hand. Buri-bokh cut Belgutei's bare
shoulder with his sword. Belgutai was cut like this, but Genghis Khan, who was sitting
in the shade and getting married, saw his blood flowing down his body and came out
and said: "Who was cut like this?" Belgutai said: "This happened this morning. Don't let
the brothers fight over me! I won't get tired. I'm fine. The brothers are just getting
along, so don't fight over me, brother, just wait a moment."
132. Genghis Khan, ignoring Belgute's persuasive words, pulled out the tree
limbs from both sides, pulled out the ayrg's pin, fought, defeated the
Jurkhins, and captured Khorigin and Khourchin. [Khasar
Every shot killed one person. Belgutey fought with a whip and a spear. The Thais caught
Belgutey and tied him to the cart. After he fell asleep, Belgutey came back carrying the
spear. A.to] We agreed to make peace with the Jurhins and returned Khorigin Khatan and
Khuurchin Khatan. At that time, the Golden Khan of China and the Tatar Megujin Sutlej
were not going to enter the country, so he sent Wangin Changsan with an army and told
him to fight them immediately. Wangin Changsan, led by Megujin-Yemmet, fought with
the Tatars and quickly drove them to a place called Ulz with horses and cattle. He received
the news that
133. Genghis Khan said: "The Tatars are the enemy who killed our ancestors. Now let
us join in this battle." He sent a messenger to Tooril Khan and said, "Altan Khan's
Wangin Changsan and Megujin-suilt are leading the Tatars to Ulz and are afraid. Let
us fight the vengeful Tatars who have harmed our ancestors. Tooril Khan, come
immediately." Having received this message, Tooril Khan said: "My son (Genghis) has
spoken the right words. Let us join in the fight." On the third day, he gathered his
army and rode out, and Tooril immediately arrived to meet Genghis. Genghis Khan
and Tooril Khan sent a message to the Jurhins led by Sacha Beghi: "Let us join this
battle and fight the Tatars who harmed our ancestors." They waited for six days, but
they did not come. Tired of waiting, Genghis Khan and Tooril Khan took their army
and went to Ulz to join Wangin Changsan. At the place called Khusutu Shituen and
Naratu Shituen in Ulz, the Tatars led by Tatar Megujin-suult built a fortress. Genghis
Khan and Tooril Khan captured the Megujin-suults from their fortress, killed Megujin-
suult there, and Genghis Khan took the silver cradle and the blanket decorated with
tana gems as prisoners.
134. When Genghis Khan and Tooril Khan announced that Megujin-suul had been killed,
Wangin was very happy to hear this and awarded him the title of Chauthuri (Rashid Eddin
explained that Chauthuri means powerful lord in Chinese).
He awarded the title of king to Tooril of Khareid. Wangin Changsan, who gave him the title of
king, from then on Tooril was called king. Wangin Changsan said: "You have done a great service
to Altan Khan by killing Megujin-sul. I will tell Altan Khan about this service. Altan Khan should
know that Genghis Khan should be awarded a greater title than this." Wangin Changsan returned
with joy. Genghis Khan and Wang Khan divided the Tatars and returned home.
135. Our soldiers found a small child abandoned in the territory of Naratu Shituen,
where the Tatars were hiding. He was wearing a golden earring with four studs
and a silk jacket lined with fur. Genghis Khan brought the child and gave it to his
mother Oelun as a gift. Oelun said to her: "He is the son of a good man. He is the
son of a noble man. Let him be the sixth son after the five sons, and she named
him Shigihutag."
136. Genghis Khan's aurag ger (back ger) was at Harilt Lake. The Jurhins attacked those who
had stayed behind in Genghis Khan's family, robbed fifty people of their clothes and killed ten
people. When the Jurhins, who had stayed behind, told Genghis Khan that the Jurhins had
destroyed us like this, Genghis Khan was very angry and said: "Why are the Jurhins doing this
to us? They killed the cook Shikhur while we were getting married in the Onon forest. They
cut off Belgute's shoulder. We returned Khorigin and Khuurchin to them when we said we
would make peace. After that, we will join forces with the ancient Tatars who had harmed our
ancestors, and the Jurhins were forced to fight for six days.
"I waited, but they did not come. Now, the enemy has become an enemy alongside the enemy," said
Genghis Khan, and he set out to fight Jurhin. When Jurhin was at a place called Dolon Kuldung on the
Khuddeu Island of Kherlen, he attacked Sacha Behi Taichu and a few people, and they were defeated.
He followed them from the north and overtook them at a place called Teletu Am, and captured Sacha
Behi Taichu and his men. When they captured them, Genghis Khan said to Sacha Behi Taichu, "What
did we discuss before?" Sacha Behi Taichu said to him, "If we do not keep our word, keep our word,"
and reminded them of their previous words, forced them to keep their word, and killed them.
137. When Sacha and Taichu were finished, the citizens of Jurhin were moved, among them
were three sons of the wealthy Telegetu of Jalayir: Gun Gua, Chuluun Khaich, and Zevgee. Gun
Gua, Mukhulai (Mukhuli) Bukha sent their sons to Genghis
Meet and greet:
"Your threshold"
Let it be a slave!
From your doorstep
If you dodge,
Cut the scythe!
Your door
May it be property!
From your doorstep
If you miss it, please leave.
"The elephant is sick!"
". Stonecutter Tunge Hashi brought his two sons together and said:
"Your golden threshold"
Stay safe Ash.
From your golden threshold
Going to class
Kill them, cut off their lives,
and open your wide door.
Please give it to me.
From your perspective
If you go in another direction
"The debt is paid off."
Zevgee was given to Hasar. Zevgee found a boy named Borohul in the land of Jurkhin
and presented him to Mother Oelun.
138. Mother Oelun, the son named Hukhu, whom she had obtained from the Mergids, and Hokhuchu, whom she had
obtained from the land of the Tais, Shigihutu, whom she had obtained from the land of the Tatars, and Borohul, whom
she had obtained from the land of the Jurhins, were taking care of these four sons in their home. Mother Oelun said to
her sons: "Let us make these eyes that see by day and ears that hear by night."
139. The origin of the Jurkhin tribe is from the Ohinbarkhag clan, the elder of the seven sons
of Khabul Khan. His son Sorkhatu Jurkhin, the father of Jurkhin, was the eldest of the sons of
Khabul Khan, and therefore among the subjects
Intense in nature
With juice in the liver
Angry in the lungs
With velvet on the lips
Strong and
Scientists
He separated and gave it to his son. Thus, the fierce and hard-hearted people came
together, and they were called Zhurhin. [A.to, born of a man] Genghis Khan, who
degraded and subdued such fierce people, made many of them his subjects.
140. Genghis Khan said, one day, let's have Buri-bokh and Belgutei fight. Buri-bokh was
in Jurhin. Buri-bokh, in the past, could hold Belgutei with one hand and knock him down
with one foot, and he could not move. Buri-bokh was a famous wrestler of the country.
This time, when Buri-bokh and Belgutei fought, Buri-bokh, who was an invincible man,
fell. Belgutei, having pressed Buri-bokh's shoulder and stepped on the saari belt, looked
at Genghis Khan with awe, and Genghis Khan was shocked. Belgutei came to his
senses, grabbed Buri-bokh by the waist, pulled him by the chest and buttocks, and
broke his back. Buri-bokh, having broken his back, said: "I will not be defeated by
Belgutei. I fell down on purpose and died, I" Belgutei broke his back and dragged him
away. The eldest of the seven sons of Khabul Khan was Ohinbarkhag, the second was
the hero Bartan. His son was Yesukhei the hero. The third was Khutugt Monkhor, his
son Buri-bokh, Buri-bokh was better than the sons of Bartan the hero in wrestling and
was friends with the brave sons of Barkha. Thus, the state wrestler Buri broke his back
and died.
141. Later, in the year of the rooster (1201), the Khatagin Saljis, together with the Khatagins
led by Bagu Chorkhi, the Saljis led by Chirhi Tei Baatar, the Four Tatars led by Khachiun Behi,
who were friendly with the Dürven Tatars, the Tatars led by Alchi, the Tatars led by Jali Bukha,
the Ihires led by Tuge Maha, the Teneg Emel Alkhui of the Khongirads, the Gorlos led by
Choyog Tsagaan, the Khuchuguds from the Naimans, the Buyrug Khan of the Naimans, the
sons of the wise Togtoa Behi of the Oirs, the Khuduga Behi of the Oirs, the Targudai Hiriltug of
the Tais, the Khodun Orchan [Mongolian A.to] Auchu Baatar, and other Tais, gathered at a
place called Alkhui Bulag and discussed the elevation of Jamukh of the Jajirdai tribe to Khan,
killed a stallion and swore an oath, and from there In the Great Meadow, on the banks of the
Khan River, which flows into the Ergune River, Jamukh was honored as the khan of the
dynasty. After honoring Jamukh as the khan of the dynasty (khan of all), Genghis Khan said
that they would go to fight with Van Khan. A man named Khoriday from Gorlos came to
Genghis Khan at a place called Khurelkh and told him about this. Genghis Khan took this
message and informed Van Khan, who, upon hearing it, immediately led his army and came to
Genghis Khan.
142. As soon as Wang Khan arrived, Genghis Khan and Wang Khan together rode to the Kherlen
River to fight against Jamukh. Genghis Khan sent three men, Altan, Huchar, and Daridai, as
leaders. Wang Khan sent three men, Sengun, Jakha Khambu, and Bilge Beg, as leaders. He also
sent a guard ahead of this leader and set up a guard post at a place called Engen Gyuletu.
Behind him, he set up a guard post at a place called Chikhurhu. When Altan, Huchar, and
Sengun, who were leading the way as leaders, were about to reach a place called Uthiya, a man
from the guard post at Chikhurhu came running and reported, "The enemy is coming." He
received the news and, wanting to get a clear message from the enemy, he went to meet them
without stopping, met the enemy's leader, and asked, "Who is it?" "If you ask, the Mongol Auchu
Baatar, sent by Jamukh as a leader, Buyrug Khan of Nayam, Hutu, the son of Togtoa Behi of
Meergid, and Huduga Behi of Oir are the four who are going. Our leader, after discussing with
them and agreeing to fight tomorrow, returned to the river in the evening and camped there for
the night."
143. The next day, the two men met at a place called Khuyten and fought each other, pushing
each other forward and retreating. Also, Buyrug Khan and Huduga knew the method of zad
(making a storm, causing a storm). When the two of them caught hold of the zad and the method
they created, they fell on them and could not move in the mud, saying, "The wrath of heaven has
fallen on us," and they were crushed.
144. Buyrug Khan of Naiman set out for Ulugtag, a place in the Altai Mountains. Hutu, the son of
Togtoa of Mergid, set out for Selenga. Huduga Behi of Oird set out for Shisgis, seeking forests.
Jamukha himself robbed the citizens whom the Khan had honored and returned to Ergune. When
they were thus defeated, Van Khan sent Jamukha to Ergune. Genghis Khan sent Auchu Baatar of
the Tais to Onon. Auchu Baatar, having reached his country and having dispersed his country,
Auchu Baatar and Khodun Orchan prepared the remaining best troops and waited for the battle
behind Onon. Genghis Khan arrived and fought with the Tais. After a fierce battle, they spent the
night at the place where they had fought. The families of the Durevsens surrounded them with
the soldiers who had fought.
145. Genghis Khan, who was wounded in the neck in that battle, was exhausted and suffered
from a blood clot, and when the sun set, he descended to the battlefield. Zelme sucked
Genghis's blood with his mouth, his lips bleeding, and he did not trust anyone else, and he sat
there all night. When the night passed, drinking and pouring blood with his mouth full, Genghis
Khan regained consciousness and said: "The blood has dried up. I am thirsty." From there,
Zelme took off all his hat, shoes, and robes, and ran into the enemy's midst, naked only in his
underwear (underwear), climbed onto the civilian chariot that had surrounded him and did not
find any. Because the fleeing families had left their horses unsaddled. Since no one could find a
jug, Zelme brought a large jug with a spout, and Zelme himself found water, mixed the jug, and
gave Genghis Khan a drink.
Genghis Khan drank three times and said, "I am sober," and sat up, and the
dawn broke. The blood that Zelm had spilt turned the area around them into a
swamp. Genghis Khan saw this and said, "What is this? Why don't you go far?"
To this Zelme said, "When you were in pain, I was afraid to go far, and I kept
swallowing and spitting. My stomach also felt very heavy." Genghis Khan also
said, "Why did you run away naked while I was lying like this? If you were
caught, wouldn't you have said that I would lie here like this?" Zelme said, "I
thought so.
"If I were to be caught naked, I would tell them: I would like to enter your house. But my people
would know this and, in order to capture me and kill me, would take off all my clothes, leaving only
my trousers undone, and I would say that I escaped and came to you in vain." They would believe me
and give me clothes and take care of me. Then I would find a horse and ride it to the end? I thought of
this and decided to leave in the blink of an eye to comfort the khan's suffering body." Genghis Khan
said: "What should I say now? When I was killed by three margids before, and when I took refuge in
Burkhan Khaldun, and united them three times, you took my life once. Now you have also taken the
overflowing blood with your mouth and entered my life once. And when I was thirsty and tired, you
risked your life and entered the enemy's midst and brought it to me. I will never forget these three
kindnesses of yours." The decree was issued.
146. When the day came, the enemy soldiers who had been ready for battle had been scattered
during the night. However, the surrounding people and soldiers could not move quickly, so
they did not move. When Genghis Khan wanted to capture the Durevsen country, he rode out
from the place where he had spent the night and was on his way to capture the Durevsen
country. When Genghis Khan heard a woman in a red robe crying loudly, "Temujin, Temujin," he
sent someone to ask. When the man went to ask, the woman said: "I am the daughter of
Sorkhon-shar. My name is Khadaan. My husband is here and the soldiers are going to kill him.
Save my husband and call out to Temujin and cry." When the man returned and told Genghis
Khan what he had said, Genghis Khan heard him, he rode up to him, dismounted from his
horse, and embraced Khadaan. However, our soldiers had already killed her husband in the
meantime. Having divided the country, Genghis Khan and his army camped there for the night.
He invited Hadaan and made him sit next to him. The next day, Sorkhon-shar and Zev, who
were subjects of the Tai tribe of Todeg, arrived. Genghis Khan said to Sorkhon-shar:
"I've got a lump in my throat."

Removed
Be like a father.
Dear brother,
"Why did you win so much?"
". Sorkhon-shar said: "I still trust you deeply. What's the hurry? If I come
early, the Thai princes might burn my late wives, sons, and horses to ashes,
so I did not hurry. Now I have come to join the king." Hearing these words,
Genghis Khan said: "That's right."
147. And Genghis Khan said: "When we were fighting in the cold place,
advancing and retreating, who shot from the mountain and pierced the mouth
of my white horse?" Hearing those words, Zev said: "I am the one who shot
from the mountain. Now the king has killed me."
If you want to kill, kill.
A palm-sized area
To make a mess
There is a body in front.
I thought it was a disaster.
If you give me my life
I jumped to the place
called Khald.
Until the black water is drained
Until the rocks crumble
Attacking the enemy
Let me help you, King.
Until the water of the well is drained
Until the stone breaks
Take courage,
Genghis, let me help you.
When I reach the
place called Khur,
Let's take a look at the stone.
Let's break people's hearts!"
Genghis Khan said: "The enemy is a group of people who lie to hide their hostility
and harm. But you are honest and do not hide your hostility and harm. You can
befriend such a person. I will remove your name Zurgaadai, and I will give you the
name Zev because you shot rust into the mouth of my white horse in battle.
Protect me like rust." This was the order given to Zev from the Tais. (It seems that
Genghis is hiding his own wound and saying that his horse was wounded.)
THE CONQUEST OF THE TATAR AND THE BREAK WITH THE VAN KHAN
148. Genghis Khan attacked the Thais there and massacred the nobles of the Thais, including
Auchu Baatar, Khodun Orchan, and Khuduudar, down to the last man. He deported the citizens,
and Genghis Khan spent the winter in a place called Hubhaya (Ukhaa Khaya).
149. [When Genghis Khan was traveling in the countryside, one day he took nine ministers
from the interior to search for and monitor the goods, and ordered: "Any enemy may come
from any direction, my nine ministers, go in three groups." Following this order, Zelme, Chuu
wise, and Shigihutu formed three groups. Boorchi, Borohul, and Mukhulai formed three
groups. Sorkhon-shar of Suldu, Zev of Besud, and Khar Khiruge of Oir formed three groups
and stayed at home. The master took the other six ministers to search for and monitor the
goods, and escorted Chakharai Khan and Zalman Khan, and then left under the master.

The fallen bow

Spreading out
The colorful one
Shoot until the end
Immediately after killing
The minister behind
Get off safely.
Until I started to stumble.
The master ordered: "You will eat this with a sore throat. I will go up to that yellow saddle and look
around." He left. There the master fell asleep, and resting his whip on the mane of the spotted brown
horse, he fell asleep and had a dream. Genghis Khan woke up, went to his six ministers and ordered:
"I had a dream, my
brown heart.
If you do, you will.
My short ribs
It was done very well.
An impossible enemy
It seems to be coming.
Beyond the high mountain
On the wide yellow side
With three black flags
There are three hundred enemies.
Three hundred enemies
The hero is a major.
Riding a horse in the wilderness
Unfold your rusty arrows.
Put on your armor.
Stroking his dark beard
Turn right.
Looking to the left
It stings like a needle.
It's like a thread.
"If this dream of mine is true, what will you, my six ministers, do?" asked
Shigihutu. He said:
"Looking around"
With two sharp eyes
Mongolia province
Mokhtol
Merged province
Magdertel
The Thais are the province.
Daldirtal
The place of the moon
Looking at the screen
The place of the year
Annual review
With a black-eyed flower
Let me help you, King.
With a rolling gaze
"May God help you."
Zelme said:
"Death to the soul"
No love
The animal that will die.
No regrets.
The visible enemy
Attack until you slip.
What happened on the way?
Hit the back
What happened to you?
Hit the ground running
The black flag
Participate
The one who caught it
Kill in battle
The only thing left to do is to cut it.
Stepping on the ground
The flag of Uranhai
Stepping on the edge
The enemy's horde
Killed by force
Rise again
"Let's kill those who can."
The wise man said:
"Although unable to invade, I am capable
of confirming what has been decided. I am
not able to attack directly, but I am able
to repair the Broken. I am the wise one
with a strong character,
When it's time to retreat,
maybe I'll run away.
Let me tell the king in advance.
After establishing your country, you
can help with your words. When
attacking a foreign enemy, Genghis
Khan will help you.
"My clever words, they can
sometimes help."
Boorchi said:
"The enemy who will come to fight
Fill in the previous path.
The enemy who is coming
Block the way to jump.
Yours, my lord.
Protect the body
Your golden steering wheel
Follow without fail
In the direction you are heading.
"Let's go without delay."
Borohul said:
"Shooting arrows"
Become a canopy
Rusty rust
Become a shield
Yours faithfully,
In the body to eat
Sharp knife
"Don't let me."
Muhulai said:
"Suppress the enemy"
Bring in the loot
The coming enemy
To dull the blade
The enemy will return.
Kill the bull
The horse's horse
Over the tail
Inhaling the mist
Of the fallen horse
Over the hill
Beautiful sunshine
Emitting red light
Won every battle
Goodbye, good news.
"I congratulate you, hero."
Genghis:
Top six ministers
Listen to the decisive words
and eat the grilled meat.
After finishing eating,
Giving the yellow horse's mane to Shigihutug,
he said, "My dream
"Know the truth from the lie"
He sent.
Shigihutu, the proud yellow horse, rode away.
Placed on the plain
Walking in the taiga
The valley is dry.
Spread it on the ground.
Reaching the yellow meadow
If you look closely,
Enemy soldiers in Balmad,

He came galloping along:
"On the yellow carpet

With three hundred enemies

The Thais
I don't know.
Mergid
I didn't know.
Mongolia
I couldn't see Mokhtol.
"Just by looking to the north, it looks like the enemy I saw in my master's dream." Then the
six ministers put on their armor, slung their shields, and prepared for battle when the
enemy army arrived.
The hero Boorchi
Riding on a gray horse
On behalf of the enemy, Samuun
Go find Samba.
Asking for courage:
"What kind of person are you? If you are a man of honor, speak your mind! If you are a man of honor, speak your name," they said.
"To ask your name."
We didn't come,
To fight until it penetrates
"Here we come"
Boorchi said:
"Tell me goodbye."
"You can forgive me with friendship.
If you have any intention of fighting,
let's start with the Sun Fire."
Then the person behind him said:
"We don't have a good
name for you.
"We are a people of marmots and fishermen."
Then Shigihutu said: "There is no need to ask them for advice. They are known to be Thais. Let's fight
without hesitation." Borohul ran down, picked up his brown shield, and stood to protect his Bogd lord.
Zelme, having caught the sword from the enemy, entered
What happened to you?
Cut until you reach the road.
The three black flags
were pulled by Gul.
Take me to the mountain
He stabbed her with his head facing up.
The wise man was already exhausted. While the horseman was running forward, he looked
back at the wise man and said: "Oh, wise man, come on! Do you work so hard for the emperor!
Why are you running away like a dead man who has come out of a hole?" The wise man turned
back and laughed and said: "If we fight side by side, you are exhausted." The master pulled out
his golden sword from his golden shield. The wise man pulled out the sword, stretched it out,
and drew it back, stretched it out, and directed it back, and shot the enemy's head, and caught
the bald horse and brought it to the master. When the master saw the horse, it was like a flying
bird or a gust of wind. Then he crushed the enemy who was about to break through, and the
enemy who was about to be stabbed
While he was fishing, an arrow hit Borokhul's head, and he fell down, grabbed his bow,
and, leaning on his shield, stood still. While Borokhul was fighting forward, he looked
back and said to him: "Can a man be killed by a single arrow? Why do you hesitate, like
a horse that has been hit in the back?" Borokhul, jumping on the wrong side of his
horse, grabbed his shield and fought carelessly. Then the enemy who had attacked him
took the body of his slain man and left. The king ordered:
"What to do with an enemy who treats you badly?" Boorchi said:
"The man who became God
Farewell with kindness
The enemy who treated you wrong
The iron rusts.
"Let's go," the master agreed to the request. He overtook the enemy on the white side of the citadel, and
like a wolf among many sheep, he killed one hundred men. Two hundred men were missing. In this battle,
he captured one hundred horses and fifty pieces of armor.
At that time, Genghis Khan, wanting to worship his heavenly father, climbed a
high hill, spread out his books, hung his belt around his neck, and prayed:
"Good luck,
The Lord is gone, I am.
The sky is right.
With the love of the Father
I am a lord.
Thanks to Father Heaven
I have defeated my enemy.
Good luck to you.
I am no longer a king. I
am the king of heaven.
"I became the master through love. By
the mercy of the heavenly father, I
crushed the foreign enemy."
He bowed. As he rode away from there, he praised his master and six
ministers. First, he praised Shigihutu:
"Making Mergid suffer"
Defeat Mongolia
Getting to know Thais
The enemy was suppressed.
"My Tatar Shigihutu," he praised.
Praising Zelmi
"The deer's nest"
It's been a while.
(Hunting deer)
You know)
The enemy of the tribe
Heart-wrenching
When there is no horse to ride
The car was brought.
When thirsty, drink
Gave me wine to drink.
Awake, sleepy
Wise and intelligent
For politics
Worked hard from the beginning
"My good Zelme of Uriankhan," he praised.
The wise man was praised:
"Follow my commandments without fail, carry
out my instructions without fail, and defeat the
enemy leader."
Eagle shooting
The fallen gazelle's horse was
captured by Uulgalan.
The enemy to be defeated
Hit it hard.
The enemy of conflict
Nuclear strike
"My wise man, Chuu Zurchidi," he praised.
Praising Borohul:
"In the arrow of the arrow"
It became a canopy.
In Surkhirah district
It became a shed.
When you hurt your head
I didn't lose my temper.
"My good Borohul, Khushi," he praised.
Praise for Muhulai:
"Suppress the enemy"
Bring in the loot
The coming enemy
Sharpen the blade.
The enemy retreats.
Bovi is being watched.
The mist of the sky hangs over
the tail of the horse.
The rising sun shines on the
mane of the fallen horse
From enemy property
Leave no broken thread.
No broken needles.
I brought it.
"My good Muhulai," he praised.
Praise for the farmer:
"When I was young, I was
looking for the Eight Jewels,
and the sun was rising."
Since you met me
Worked honestly at Nasad
The son of a rich man
My dear friend, Boorchi! When you
leave home for a while
Even though he was as gentle as a spotted
calf, when he met a deadly enemy, he
became as fierce as a lion, and in order to
suppress the dangerous enemy, he did not
love life or death.
My dear horse, Boorchi! When
you are about to leave,
Even though he was as gentle as a
black bull, when faced with a fierce
enemy, he became as fierce as a black
falcon, fearlessly sacrificing his life to
crush the foreign enemy.
My beloved knight, Boorchi! When
you smile and go away
Even though he was as docile as a calf, when
he encountered the enemy,
Fierce like a fierce beast, To crush the
corrosive enemy, The faithful one who
does not love himself
My dear husband, Boorchi!
It's time to go.
As gentle as a fall foal, but
when faced with an enemy,
Nachin attacks like a falcon.
Always striving for life
My friend, my horse, my
friend! I will not return.
Follower of the king
"My beloved knight, Boorchi," he sang in praise.
When the master finished praising his six ministers, Boorchi sang in praise of his master:
"Yesuhei has a heroic father"
With nine masons
O Genghis Khan, the Lord of the
Universe, who has conquered all! Oelun
Queen, my mother!
The masonry has nine officers.
Ogedei, Tolui, with his son, is
full of mercy and love.
Countries of every color
Bowed down
All the enemies are vengeful.
Stepped under the tree
My high and mighty Emperor!
When you are the Khan, from the
foreign enemy
No shedding.
When you are the Lord's hero, you are
the Sovereign's enemy.
No worries.
Everyone together.
Let's unite like relatives and
defeat the foreign enemy, Let's
enjoy the heat, Like swans and
geese
Let's have fun together.
In the words of a liar
Let's go inside.
Like a falcon
Let's go up and down.
In the war of attrition
Hot life
Don't love me.
Like a bird of prey
Don't kill your beloved... To the
enemy who will kill you.
Don't love your life.
Among relatives
Let's not lose our harmony.
"When facing the enemy who will
possess me, do not love this body."
These are the words sung by Huleg Boorchi.
Genghis Khan, the great warrior, went out at noon and defeated three hundred Thais, and
returned home safely and peacefully. A.to] The naked old man Shireet of the Barin and his
son Alag Naya found the chief of the Thais, Targudai Hiriltu, hiding in the forest, and when
he was taken away by a chariot [to Temujin], the sons and brothers of Targudai-Hiriltu came
to claim him. As soon as they arrived, the old man, Shireet, knocked the helpless Targudai
down, made him lie down on his back, sat on his stomach, drew his knife, and said: "Your
sons, your brothers, have come to take you away. If I do not kill you now, Khan, I will kill you
because you have already attacked me. If I kill you, I will be killed in the same way.
Therefore, I will make you a pillow and die." He put the blade of the knife to Targudai's
throat, and Targudai-Khiriltu, his brothers, cried loudly to his sons: "Shireet, you are going to
kill me. If you kill me, what will you do with my body? Return immediately if you have not
killed me. Temujin, you will not kill me. I found Temujin, a young man with fire in his eyes, a
bright face, and a bright talent, while he was abandoned in a foreign land, and I taught him
as if I were teaching him to be a good son. He had been raising him. At that time, he could
have easily killed him, but he had raised him with mercy. Now Temujin must have
understood him in his mind and had become wiser in his heart. Temujin, you will not kill me.
You, my sons and brothers, see me dead (quickly). Shireet, do not kill me," he cried loudly,
and his sons and brothers heard him and discussed: "I came to save my father's life.
However, if this old Shireet kills me, what will we do with my lifeless body? Let's go back now,
since we did not kill him." As soon as they were hidden, Alag Naya, the son of Shireet, who
had escaped from the Tais, returned to his father. Shireet, together with his sons, took
Targuidai and set off to a place called Hutukhul-Nuga. There, Naya said: "If we capture this
Targudai, Genghis Khan will not believe us as unfaithful people who have captured his
master, but will kill us as people who have attacked his master. Now, let's send Targudai
back from here and go to Genghis Khan in person and say this: "We, Genghis Khan, have
come to give you our power. When we were about to say, "We brought Targudai-Khiriltu, but
on the way we kept looking at our master, and how could we give him to a foreigner, we left
him on the way, and we came to worship you and follow you," the father and sons agreed to
Naya's words, and sent Targudai-Khiriltu away from the Hutukhul-nu, and Shireet Uggen and
Alag Naya, along with their two sons, arrived at Genghis Khan. When asked why they had
come, Shireet Uggen told Genghis Khan: "We brought Targudai-Khiriltu, but on the way we
kept looking at our master, and how could we give him to a foreigner, we left him on the
way, and we ourselves came to give our strength to Genghis Khan."
Genghis Khan said:
"Khan Targudai"
If it was brought by force
Attacked on the wall
Look at the people.
But you, because you
cannot be trusted,
Relatives
A group to kill together.
The king loved his master.
Your warm heart
"That's right," he said, forgiving Naya affectionately.
150. After that, when Genghis Khan was in a place called Dersud, Jakha Khambu of the Kheri
came to befriend him. At that time, when the Mergids came to befriend him, Genghis Khan
and Jakha Khambu fought and defeated him. There, the Tumen Tubeg, who was a defeated
citizen of the Kherids, came to Genghis Khan. Van Khan of the Kherids had previously become
friends with Yesukhei the hero. The reason for this friendship was that Van Khan, after killing
the brothers of his father, Hurchahus Nurug Khan, fought with his uncle Gur Khan, took
refuge in a place called Haraun Gorge, and escaped from there with only a hundred people.
When Yesukhei Khan came, Yesukhei Khan took care of him, took his own army, and rode to
Khashin, leaving Gur Khan in need, and gave his subjects and livestock to Van Khan, so they
became friends.
151. After him, Erkh Khar, the younger brother of Wang Khan, was afraid of being killed by his brother Wang
Khan, and went to Inancha Khan of Naiman. When Inancha Khan arrived with an army, Wang Khan left,
wandered through three cities, and went to Gur Khan of China. He broke off relations with that khan, and
traveled through the ruins of Uyghur cities and Tangud, milked five goats, and ate camel blood to his
heart's content. When he reached Guseur Lake, Genghis Khan remembered that he had previously fought
with Yesukhei Baatar, and sent Dahai Baatar and Suhehei Jeun as messengers to greet him, and then,
having been picked up by Genghis Khan himself from the beginning of Kherlen and starved, Van Khan
collected a tribute from his subjects and fed him. That winter, he moved with them, and Genghis Khan
wintered in Hubakhaya.
152. At that time, the younger princes of Wang Khan discussed:
"This Khan, our
kinsman,
Can be blown away by the ashes
I have a bad idea.
There is no one who can
do it, my dear brother.
Killed together
In Black China too
I begged for protection.
I don't love my country at all.
It was cruel and painful.
What to do with this? When he was seven years old, he was captured by the Mergids, put on a
black turban, and went to the Selenga Buur steppe to grind rice in the Mergid land. His father,
Khurchahus Nurug Khan, defeated the Mergids and rescued his son. However, when this Tooril
was thirteen years old, he was captured by the Tatar Ajay Khan with his mother and went to
herding his camels. From there, he escaped with Ajay Khan's shepherd and returned home. After
that, when he was less than eight years old, he crossed the Chui River in the Sartaul region and
went to the Gur Khanate of China. There he stayed for a year, wandering through the Uyghur
lands, passing through the Tangud lands, milking five goats (to deflower a goat or to shave the
head of a goat), and eating camel blood to his heart's content, he had only one blind white horse.
When he came to Temujin, Temujin took him as a boy and a donkey. "But now he has forgotten
how he left and is carrying a stinking liver," he said. Van Khan conveyed this discussion to Altan
Ashug. Altan Ashug said: "I participated in this private conversation. However, the Khan will tolerate
you." "I couldn't, so I told you everything I heard." Wang Khan arrested the younger brothers,
Elhudur, Khulbari, and Arin Taij, who had discussed those words. Wang Khan's younger brother
Jaha Hambu, who was not able to do so, went to Naiman. Wang Khan took his younger brothers
into a house and said, "How did you say that you went to the Tangut land in the Uyghur land?
What evil did you think?" He spat in their faces, made the entire household stand up and spit on
them, and put them in chains.
153. That winter, in the autumn of the Dog Year (1202), before Genghis Khan fought the White Tatars,
the Alchi Tatars, the Tutaud Tatars, and the Alukhai Tatars at a place called Dalan Nemurge, Genghis
Khan issued a decree: "When you defeat the enemy, do not hold back on the spoils. If the enemy is
defeated, their goods will always be our spoils, so we will divide them up. If we are forced to retreat,
we should immediately return to the place we attacked first. Whoever does not return to that place
will be executed." He declared this decree. He fought the Tatars at a place called Dalan Nemurge and
defeated them. He fought them and captured them at a place called Ulkhui Shilugeljid. When the
Tsagaan Tatars, Alchi Tatars, Tutaud Tatars, and Alukhai Tatars were defeated and the three Altan
Khuchar Daridai violated the punishment prescribed when they conquered the subjects and, greedy
for booty, stayed away from the battle. Zev and Kublai were sent away because they did not keep their
word and did not carry out the punishment prescribed, and they confiscated all their captured horses
and belongings.
154. After destroying the Tatars and conquering them all, Genghis Khan gathered his golden
family and held a great consultation in one house about what to do with his people. Their advice
was:
"From ancient times to the present"
To finish off these evil Tatars
who harmed my ancestors
in Egneg
Measure the wheelbase.
Let's delete it by saying no.
The remaining wife and children
Divided into each door
"Let's make them slaves forever."
After consulting, he decided, and when he left the house, the Tatar Ikh-Cheren asked
Belgut, "What did you decide?" Belgut answered, "We have decided to measure all of
you with a ruler and kill all those who are taller than you." Hearing Belgut, Ikh-Cheren
issued a proclamation to many Tatars and gathered them in the fortress. Our soldiers
suffered greatly because they broke their fortifications. When the Tatars gathered in the
fortress were captured and killed by the ruler, each Tatar was shouting, "Let's take a
pillow and die," and our soldiers also suffered greatly. After the Tatars were
slaughtered, Genghis Khan issued a decree: "We have held a great consultation with
Belgutai, who has caused great harm to our soldiers. From now on, do not include
Belgutai in the great consultation. While the consultation is taking place, Belgutai will
control external affairs and judge disputes and thefts. After the consultation is over and
the Sarkhad is drunk, Belgutai and Daridai can enter." The decree was issued.
155. At that time, Chinggis Khan took Yesugen, the daughter of the Tatar Ikh-Cheren, as his queen. Yesugen
Queen came to Chinggis Khan's mercy and said: "If the king allows, he will take good care of me. My sister Yesuy is
better than me, and she is a beautiful woman who will be remembered by the king. I just don't know where she
went in the recent confusion." Chinggis Khan said: "If your sister is really more beautiful than you, then I will greet
her. If your sister comes, will you give her a place to stay?" Yesugen Queen said: "If the king allows, bring my sister
to meet me, I will immediately leave her." At this, Chinggis Khan made a proclamation and said: "If the king allows,
bring my sister to meet me, I will immediately leave her." At this, Chinggis Khan made a proclamation and said: "If
the king allows, yesuy queen, our soldiers saw Yesuy queen walking in the forest with her son-in-law, and brought
Yesuy queen, and her husband was missing. Yesugen Queen, upon seeing her sister, stood up and sat on her seat,
and herself sat on the lower floor. Just as Queen Yesugen had said, Queen Yesugen was truly beautiful, so Genghis
Khan took pity on her and elevated her to the rank of queen.
156. After the Tatars had finished their campaign, one day, Genghis Khan was sitting outside
the house with Yesui Khatan and Yesugen Khatan, drinking, and Yesui Khatan was very sad.
Genghis Khan became suspicious of this, and summoned Boorchi and Mukhulai, two princes,
and said: "Make all the people you have gathered here into their own aimags. Do not leave
people from other aimags in your own aimag." Then, when all the people were divided into
aimags, one young man was left without an aimag. "What kind of person are you?" he asked,
and the man said: "I am the son-in-law of Yesui, the daughter of the Tatar king Ikh-Cheren. I was
afraid of the enemy and went away without a group. Now that the war is over, I thought that I
would not be recognized among the people." When Genghis Khan was informed of this, he
issued an order: "That man has come here, wandering alone and full of evil thoughts. Isn't it
time to kill such a person? Why should he retreat? Hide him from sight." He immediately killed
him.
157. In the same year of the Dog (1202), when Genghis Khan was fighting the Tatars, Van Khan
rode out to attack the Mergids, chased Togtoa Bekh back to the Barguujin Tokhumi, killed
Togtoa's eldest son, Tugs Bekh, captured Togtoa's Khutugtai Chaalun and his two daughters and
the queen, and captured the Khutug Chuluun and his two sons along with their subjects, but did
not give anything of this booty to Genghis Khan.
158. After him, Genghis Khan and Wang Khan fought against Buirug Khan, the leader of the Naiman army.
Having set out to fight, they reached the place called Sokhogus in Ulug Tag, where they defeated
Buyru Khan and crossed the Altai. Genghis Khan and Van Khan chased Buyru Khan from
Sokhogus and crossed the Altai to the Urungu River in Khumshingir. However, their chieftain,
Edi-Toblug, was on guard and was chased by our guard and fell into the mountains, where he
was captured. They chased Buyru Khan to the Urungu River, overtook him at Lake Khishilbashi
and killed him there.
159. When Genghis Khan and Van Khan returned from there, they found the Naiman Khugseu Sabra
hero, who had gathered his army at the mouth of the Baidrag River to fight. Genghis Khan and Van
Khan also gathered their army to fight, but as it was already evening, they prepared for the fight the
next day. However, at nightfall, Van Khan left a fire at the place where he had landed and set off
across the Black Tail River.
160. That night, Jamuha, traveling with Van Khan, said to Van Khan: "Temujin
has already had relations with the Naim. Now he will not travel with us."
Khan! Khan! I won't fly
very far.
Like a beautiful bird
We are in the same place. But
my friend Temujin is like a bird
flying away.
"Where will you go to betray me?
Khan, I'm going to leave you now
and go to Hari Eighth. I'm
deliberately staying behind."
That is, hearing Jamukh's words, Ubchigdai's brown knight said: "Why are
you flattering me in vain and insulting your honest brother?"
161. Genghis Khan, having spent the night there and rising up to fight the next morning, found
that the place where Van Khan had landed was empty, and he said, "But you have deceived us and
thrown us into the ravine." Genghis Khan set off, without delay, crossing the Eder Altai steppe and
landing in the Saar steppe. From there, Genghis Khan learned what trouble the Khasar and the
eight had caused, but he did not tell anyone.
162. The hero Khugseu Sabra of Naiman pursued Van Khan, and captured all the wives,
children, property, and subjects of Sengum, and also fought with Van Khan at a place
called Telegetu amsar, and captured some subjects and horses and cattle and returned.
The two sons of the Mergid Togtoa, Hutu Chuluun, who had followed Van Khan, seized
that opportunity, took their subjects, and set off towards Selenga and joined their father.
163. Wang Khan, defeated by the hero Khugseu Sabra of Naiman, sent a messenger to
Genghis Khan and said: "The property, women, and children of Naiman have been taken
away, and I, the son, ask you to send four knights. Please save my subjects and property."
Genghis Khan organized an army and sent four knights, Boorchi, Mukhulai, Borohul, and
Chuluun, with the army. Before these four knights arrived, Ulaan
In a place called Khus, Sengum was fighting and was about to be captured after his horse
was wounded in the thigh. Four of Genghis's knights went to rescue him and saved all his
property, wives, and children. At that time, Wang Khan said: "In the past, Temujin's good
father, the hero Yesukhei, saved and gathered my scattered country. Now, the son
Temujin has also sent his four knights and saved and found my lost country. May the
blessings of heaven and earth be upon him."
164. Also, Wang Khan said:
"And Yesuhei, my hero,
saved and gathered my lost
country. His eldest son
Temujin Genghis Khan
My scattered and scattered
country has been restored.
For whom are these father and son working to
support our country?
What are you suffering for? I am a
tired old man.
Leaning on a high mountain
The grass covers the lichens.
If it goes away,
Who will inherit my
glorious country? I
am Khan Tooril.
Khanat left home.
If you go to Hadat's house
Where is the one who will
protect my country that has
been taken over? Lord
Tooril I am
Felt away from home.
If you go to Enger's house
Who will rule over my country that has
been conquered by Enkhriyelj? Even if they
are brothers by birth
The government cannot hold
The center is not behaving well.
There are many people who are very poor.
"Although he had only one son, Sengum, he had no one to marry, so let Temujin be Sengum's
brother, and let us live in peace with two sons." Then Genghis Khan and Wang met in the dark
forest of the Tuul River and became father and son. In the past, Wang Khan had become friends
with the hero Yesukhei, so he considered Wang Khan as his father, and thus they became father
and son. The words that were discussed about this are:
"Let's fight together
against the foreign enemy."
"Let's go with Havsarch to catch the
rock antelope." Also, Genghis Wang
Khan said: "The tongue of a poisonous
snake
Stirring between us
If you include gossip
Not separated, but
Two-faced encounter
Let's stop the harm. The teeth
of the beast snake
Enter between Amra
If you break the harmony
Jealousy is not born.
"Let's meet and talk in our own language,
Let's find the reason for everything"
He said firmly, and walked away.
165. After that, Genghis Khan thought of becoming a lover on top of a lover, and
asked Zuchid for Chaur Beg, Sengum's younger brother, and also asked Sengum's
son Tusahad to trade his Khojin Beg, but Sengum arrogantly thought to himself and
said: "If my family goes to them, they will always sit and watch the drought. If their
family comes to us, they will sit and watch the drought," arrogantly and insulted us,
and did not allow Chaur Beg to be given to him. This made Genghis Khan dislike
Wang Khan and Nyalkha-Sengum.
166. Jamukha learned that this was not possible, and in the spring of the year of the Pig (1203),
Jamukha, Altan, Khuchar, the great princes of the Black China, Subedei-Tooril, and Khachiun Behi,
united in friendship and moved to Berhe Elet on the Jejeer mountain ridge. They met with Nyalkha-
Sengum, and Jamukha said in a loud voice: "My friend Temujin and Dayan Khan of Naiman have
always been in contact with each other.
He,
In your mouth
Father and son are called,
but Avir's idea is
Isn't Advish different?
"Do you trust him? Do you know what will happen if you lose? If you go to
fight Temujin, I will join you from the side." Altan Khuchar said: We:
The orphans of the motherless were killed by
their brothers.
The baby is hanging.
"Let me give it to you." The black Chinese grandfather said:
"Hold his hand
His feet are tied.
"Let's give it to you." Tooril said: "Let's find a way to seize Temujin's country. If we take his
country, he will be helpless." Khachiun Behi said: "Nyalkha-Sengum, the son of the king, will
think of you and will not hesitate to reach the end of the line or the bottom of the abyss for
you."
167. Nyalkha-Sengum sent these words to his father, Van Khan, through a man named
Saikhan-Tode. When Van Khan heard these words, he said: "How can you think so badly of
the boy Temujin? If we, as a support for the boy Temujin, think badly of him, heaven will not
be pleased with us. Jamuha has always been a wandering chatterbox. He speaks in vain
about right and wrong." He returned them with displeasure. And what Sengum said: "Why
don't you believe me when I am a living man and speak with my mouth?" He sent another
person to tell him, and finally he came to his father in person and said: "Now that you are
alive, he will not ignore us. If the father Khan sprinkles you with white rice and eats you with
black meat, then he will not let us know about the country that the father Khan has suffered
and the state that you have built with your hard work." Wang Khan said: "How can we kill
our son? If we think badly of him, who is truly our support, the heavens will displease us,"
and the son Nyalkha-Sengum angrily left the house. Note that Wang Khan, loving the son,
invited him and said: "How can we kill our son for fear of displeasing the heavens? You
should know what to do if you can."
168. From there, Sengum said: "They were asking for our Chaur Bekh. Now, let's set a date
and catch him by saying, "Eat the neck." ("Eat the neck" probably means to eat the neck of a
sheep. It is still customary in Mongolia to eat the neck of a sheep for three days after the
wedding of a young man and woman. The neck and neck bones are very tightly connected,
so it symbolizes the strong bond between a man and a woman. Therefore, "Eat the neck"
probably means to hold a wedding between a man and a woman.) After discussing and
deciding, Genghis sent a man to say, "I will give you the Chaur Bekh. Come and eat the
neck." Thus, Genghis Khan, accompanied by ten men, spent the night at Mengli's father's
house on the way to Wang Khan. Mengli's father said to him: "Just now, when we asked for
Chaur Bekh, we were not insulted. Now, it is strange to suddenly invite you to eat a slur.
People who were arrogant and ignored us recently, why would they suddenly give us Chaur
Bekh? There is something suspicious about this. You, my son, need to be careful. It is spring
now. Our horses are thin. Why don't we go as soon as our horses are fat and postpone this
matter?" Genghis Khan took his word for it and did not go himself, but sent Bukhatai and
Hiratai to "Eat a slur," and Genghis Khan and Mengli returned from their father's house. As
soon as Bukhatai and Hiratai had gone, the Sengums said, "Our case has been revealed.
Let's cover it up early tomorrow."
169. When they had thus decided to arrest him, Altan's younger brother Ikh-Cheren came
home and said: "Tomorrow morning, we have decided to arrest Temujin. Temujin will not
give anything to the person who delivers this message." His mother Alakhchit said: "What
is the use of your evil words and false speech? People will believe them." Their horseman
Badai, who had come to deliver this message, heard it and returned. Badai came to meet
him.
When the husband told the horseman Khishilig what Chereng had said, Khishilig said, "I will
also go and find out the reason." When he went to Chereng's house, Chereg's son Narin-
gegeen was sitting outside, sharpening his arrows. Narin-gegeen said, "What did our people
just say? Hold your tongue and keep your mouth shut." Then Narin-gegeen said to the
horseman Khishilig, "Bring the two horses, Mergidiin Tsagaan and Am Tsagaan Kheer.
Harness them overnight and ride them early in the morning." Khishilig came and told Badai:
"Your flag (saya) has come true. Now, let us tell Temujin." They fought, and they caught two
horses, the white and the white-backed Mergid, and tied them outside the great house. In
the evening, they went to the sheepfold, killed a lamb, made a fire in their iser (bed), and
rode on two horses, the white and the white-backed Mergid, and that night they came to
Genghis Khan. Badai Khishilig told Genghis Khan all that Ikh-Cheren had said, and that his
son Narin-gegeen was preparing his arrows and that he should catch and tie the two
horses, the white and the white-backed Mergid. Badai Khishilig also said: "If Genghis Khan
gives his word, there is no doubt in our words. It is probably true that we have discussed
and decided to come and capture you together."
THE STATE OF KHEREY
170. Hearing this, Genghis Khan believed the words of Badai Khishilig and
informed his trusted companions who were at night, left his men and rode away
lightly. When Mau went up the ridge, he placed Zelme of Urian Khan as a guard.
Continuing in this way, at sunrise the next day, he reached Kharhalzan and landed
in the evening. While he was there, Chikhi and Yadir, the herdsmen of Aldchidai,
were grazing their herds in a beautiful pasture. Mau saw the enemy's dust coming
from the slopes of the Ulan Burgad, and hurriedly chased the herds. When
Genghis Khan saw the dust, he said that Van Khan would be afraid, so he tied up
his horses and set off. If he had not seen the dust before, he would have been
afraid. At that time, Jamukha and Van Khan had come and gone. Wang Khan asked
Jamukha: "What kind of people does Temujin have who can fight with us?"
Jamukha replied: "The Urs and Mangs are following him. They will probably fight."
Come around.
Attack and shoot
I came here with a smile.
It is oppressive.
The dark and checkered flag
Holding on
Those citizens, Bachit.
From childhood
Because he is skilled in fighting
Wang Khan, you
"It's best to be very careful."
Hearing that, Wang Khan said: "In that case, we will first lead the heroes of Zhurkhin,
led by Khadagiar. After him, we will send Achig-Shirun of the Tumen tribe. After him, we
will send the heroes of Olan Dungaid. After him, we will send Horishiremun Taij, leading
Wang Khan's thousand-strong army, to attack. After him, our main force will come." And
when the king said: "Jamukha, you must lead all our troops," Jamukha, standing alone
among the crowd, said to his comrades: "Van Khan, you are asking me to lead all your
troops. I am fighting with my friend Temujin, but you are asking me to lead your troops.
Look, Van Khan, there is someone who is weaker than me and who will be your friend
for a while. Let Temujin speak to you. Let him be strong." Jamukha sent a messenger to
Genghis Khan and said: "Van Khan, ask me. "What kind of people does Temujin have to
fight with us?" I asked, and I said: "There are strong warriors, such as Urul Mangud," so
Van Khan appointed the warriors of Jurkhin as leaders. After him, he appointed Achig-
Shirung of Tumen Tubeg. [After him] he appointed Olan Dungaid. After him, Van Khan
The chief of the Myagan Torgon army, Horishiremun, was appointed. After him, Wang
Khan led his main army. And Wang Khan said to me: "Brother Jamukha, command all
these troops." From this, [this Wang Khan] is an easy man. He cannot command his
troops himself. I have never fought with Temujin before. But Wang Khan is weaker than
me. [Therefore] Do not be afraid. Be strong." 171. Hearing this news, Genghis Khan
said: "What do you think, uncle Jorchidai of the Urs? I will send you as a leader." Before
Jorchidai could answer, the Huildar of Mangud interrupted him and said: "I will fight on
behalf of Temujin. Let Temujin know how to take care of the orphans who are left
behind." "Temujin, let us protect Jordi." Jorchidai said: "Let us lead the Uri and Manguds
to fight on behalf of Genghis Khan." Then Jorchidai and Khuildar lined up their Uri and
Manguds [troops] and prepared to march before Genghis Khan. At that moment, the
enemy, led by Jurhin, arrived. As soon as they arrived, the Uri and Manguds met them
and defeated Jurhin. However, Achig-Shirun of the Tumen tribe also attacked. Achig-
Shirun wounded Khuildar and threw him off his horse into a cliff. Seeing this, the
Manguds returned to protect Khuildar. Jorchidai led his army to fight, defeated Tumen
tribe, and then continued to attack, but when Olan attacked the Dungui, he resisted.
Jorchidai also defeated the Dungui. When he continued to attack, Horishiremun, the
chieftain, and his thousand soldiers When they led the army and defeated the Jorchidai
and Horishiremun Taiji, Sengum and Wang Khan fought against them without their
father's permission, and fell with a wound on their cheek. When Sengum fell, all the
Kheraids gathered around him. While the setting sun and the mountains were beating
down on them, our soldiers returned and took the wounded Huildar from where he had
fallen. That evening, Genghis Khan,They left the place where they had fought with King
Wang and spent the night there.
172. They spent the night there, and when the next morning dawned, they counted Ogedei,
Borokhul, and Boorchi. Genghis Khan said, "Boorchi Borokhul, Ogedei's faithful friend, has been left
behind. Whether he lives or dies, they will not be separated from him." Our soldiers stayed the
night, holding their horses. Genghis Khan said, "If the enemy attacks, we will fight," and prepared
his army. When the day dawned, a man approached from behind. He saw that it was Boorchi.
Genghis Khan, spreading his arms, said, "May the heavens know." He called Boorchi and asked him,
and he said, "My horse was wounded in the battle.
"Since I fell, I ran on foot until I found a horse with its load tied up, while the
hares were gathering at Sengum. I cut off the load and mounted it on the
goat, and I followed the trail of my army until I reached it."
173. And after a moment, a man on a horse appeared in a fright. He looked like a man, and
something like a human leg was hanging down from it. When he arrived, he saw Borohul
coming after Ogedei (Borokhul, Ogedei, was riding on his saddle). Blood was flowing from
Borohul's mouth. Because Ogedei's neck was wounded by an arrow, Borohul sucked the
spilled blood with his mouth and rolled the clot with his mouth. When Genghis Khan saw
this, tears welled up in his eyes and he was deeply distressed. He immediately lit a fire and
dressed the wound, gave Ogedei food and water, and waited for the enemy to come and
fight. Borohul said: "The enemy has hidden himself in the dust of the Mau hills, towards
Ulaan Burgad." Hearing Borohul's words, he said: "If the enemy attacks, we will fight back.
If the enemy is so weak, we will prepare our army and ask for help." He set off from there
and headed towards the Ulkhui Shilugelj [river] and reached Dalan Nemurge.
174. From there, Hadaan-Daldurkhan, separated from the women and children, came in half.
Hadaan-Daldurkhan came and told the words of Wang Khan: "Vang Khan, when the boy Sengum fell,
wounded in the cheek by an arrow, he came to him and said:
"The man of the valley
To kill.
Poor body.
You're welcome.
The person next to you
To attack
Kiss your cheek.
You are so annoying.
Beloved son
For being bitten
Foreign enemy
"Let's attack."
That is, Achig-Shirun said:
"My lord,
Erhbish is a good person.
[Ezen Khan leads
[Everyone just looks at it]
The son of the deceased
A dream come true
Do various things.
I pray, "Evii Bavii" (Good morning) This
prayer will be fulfilled.
Born from motherhood
Dear Son Sengum
Let's take care of Enkhriylen
"The majority of the Mongols (Mongols), Jamukha, Altan, and Khuchar, are here with
us. Where will the Mongols who followed Temujin go? They are horsemen and tree-
shelters (each person has only one horse and is homeless, so they are sheltering
under the trees). If they come after them, we will go and bring them back, dressed
like horse-shelters." At these words of Achig-Shirun, Wang Khan said: "Well, then the
boy will stay here. Take care of the boy," and returned from the battlefield.
175. When Genghis Khan was moving from Dalan Nemur to the Khalkh [River], he counted his army, and
found that it consisted of two thousand six hundred men. Of these, Genghis Khan took one thousand
three hundred men and moved along the western bank of the Khalkh River. The other one thousand
three hundred soldiers, together with the Manguds, moved along the eastern bank of the Khalkh River.
On the way, while he was hunting for food, Khuildar, whose wound had not yet healed, did not listen to
Genghis Khan's persuasive words, and attacked the antelopes, and his wound became infected and he
died of old age. His bones were buried in a place called Or Nugyn Heltgii Khad on the Khalkh River.
176. Hearing that the nomadic Hongiras with their carts and saddles [and their cattle]
were living at the junction of the Khalkh Gol with the Buir Lake, Genghis Khan said: "If
you remind the Hongiras of their song, which has been going on since ancient times and
still today in the color of a nephew and a daughter, they will gladly join us. If they resist,
fight and conquer." He sent a citizen led by Jorchidai down, and the Hongiras joined him.
Genghis Khan did not touch the Hongiras who had joined him at all.
177. Genghis Khan, having entered the Khongirad, moved from there and landed on the left
bank of the Tunkheleg stream. He appointed Arhai Khasar and Suhehei Jeun as messengers and
sent them to [Van Khan] to say: "We landed on the left bank of the Tunkheleg stream. The grass
has grown well here. My horses are exercising. Tell my father Khan: "Why are my father Khan
angry and afraid of me? Why are these bad sons and bad daughters-in-law not letting us sleep
peacefully?
Pushing my chair away
from me,
My smoke that comes out of the bottle,
scatters and blows away
Why did you accidentally kill your
bad son, Pandruulan?
My father Khan, you are a
man of the sidelines.
Bad words with a heart
What did you get into when you were stabbed?
Boy about me
Bad guy in the middle
Say the word "Huvssergen"
It's getting separated.
My father Khan, what did we discuss? What did we discuss at the place called
Ulaan Kuldag in Zorgal Khan?
The tongue of a poisonous snake
Stirring between us
If you include gossip
Not separated, but
Two-faced encounter
Let's stop the harm.
Didn't you discuss it? Now, my father, why did you start killing without discussing
it with two people?
Serpent's teeth
Enter between Amra
If you break the harmony
Let's meet and talk,
let's find a reason.
Didn't you discuss it? Now, my father Khan, why did you not meet and talk in person and
separate? My father Khan! I am few but no less than many, bad but no worse than good [and I
was your companion]. If one of the wheels of a two-wheeled cart breaks, the ox cannot pull it.
Isn't that a wheel like that? If one of the wheels of a two-wheeled cart breaks, it cannot move.
Isn't that a wheel like that? In the past, you became a khan as the mother of forty sons of the
father of the khan Khurchahus Nurug. When you became a khan, you killed your two brothers,
Tai-Tumur Taij and Bukha-Tumur. I, fearing that your brother Erkh-Khar would be killed, went to
the khan of Naiman Inancha Bilge and took refuge. When your uncle Gur Khan came to fight
you, saying that you had killed your brothers, you took a hundred men and went to the Selenga
to escape, and you escaped to a place called Haraun-Khavchil. When the Togtoad of Mergid
Ujaur gave his daughter to the king, he came out of the Haraun-khavchal and came to my father
Yesuhei Khan and said, "Uncle Gur Khan, save my country." Yesuhei Khan, my father, in order to
save your country, led an army led by the Hunan Bahaji of the Tais and defeated Gur Khan at a
place called Gurvan Tel with only twenty or thirty men and saved your country. At that time, you
became friends with Yesuhei Khan's father in the Black Forest of the Tuul River, and your father
Wang Khan was delighted and said, "May the blessings of heaven and earth know that even the
descendants of your family will not forget the favor you have done." After him, [your brother]
Erkh-khar, when he came to fight you with a request from Inancha Bilge Khan of Naiman, you
left your country, and with a few people you were left behind, and you reached the Gur Khan of
the Black Chinese in the Chui River, the land of Sartaul, and within a year you were separated
from Gur Khan, and you wandered through the Uyghur and Tangud lands, milking five goats and
eating camel blood to your heart's content, and you arrived with a single blind white horse. My
father, Yesukhei Khan, hearing that you were so tired, thought of our former friendship, and
sent Tahai Suhekhei and I as messengers to meet you, and I myself rode to meet you from the
Burgi bank of the Kherlen River, and we met at Lake Guseur. I gave you a gift for your arrival,
and
As my father and I were friends before, didn't we become father and son in the Black Forest of
the Tuul River? And that winter we took you into our circle and raised you. That winter, summer
passed, and in the fall we set out to fight the Mergid Togtoa Bekh, and we fought at a place
called Muruch Tail in the Khadigli Mountains. We chased the Togtoa Bekh towards the Bargujin
Tokhumi, conquered the Mergid people, and took everything from horses to livestock, houses
to food and grain. I, the Khan, gave all of this to you.
On your hungry day
I forgave and nurtured.
In the month of your birth
I have been protected and supported.
We also chased Buyrug Khan of Khugugid through the Altai at a place called Sokho Us in the Ulug Tag
(mountain), and led him to the Urungu River, and captured him at Lake Khishilbashi and killed him.
When we returned from there, the hero Khuguseu Sabrag of Naiman had prepared his army at the
mouth of the Baidrag River and [was preparing for battle. When we both had prepared our army for
battle], it was already evening, so we prepared for battle tomorrow, and spent the night there, my
father Khan, leaving many fires where you had landed, and that night we set out for the Black Tail
River.
When we saw the next morning, you had disappeared from the place where you had
landed, and we thought, "You have abandoned us like a fire that has been abandoned,"
we set off, crossed the Eder Altai steppe, and landed at a place called Saar Kheer. There,
the hero Khugseu Sabra came to you and seized all the women, property, and subjects
of Sengum, and while the Khan was at a place called Teletu Amsar, he fought you and
captured some subjects and horses. The two sons of Togtoa, the Mergid, who were
following you, took advantage of that opportunity and set off towards Bargujin Tokhum
to join their father, taking their subjects. At that time, you asked: "My son, the property
and subjects of the Naiman Khugseu sabrag have been taken. Please send your four
knights to help me." I did not have such thoughts like you, and immediately sent my
four knights, Boorchi, Mukhulai, Borohul, and Chuluun, with an army. Before my four
knights arrived, Sengum was fighting at a place called Ulan Khus and was about to be
captured after being wounded in the thigh. My four knights arrived and rescued
Sengum and saved the property and subjects, women, and children. At that time, you,
the khan, admired and said: "My son Temujin sent his four knights and saved my lost
country." Now, my khan, what wrong have I done to incur your wrath? I will send two
envoys to tell you that you are so angry and angry. "If you don't send these two, you
can send someone else."
178. Hearing these words, Wang Khan said:
"Oh, woe."
Get rid of your good boy
I have disgraced my beautiful state. I
have committed a deed of destruction,
separated from my beloved son.
He said, "If you think badly of your son (Temujin) now, I will shed my blood like this," and he
stabbed the tip of his little finger with a knife, collected the blood, put it in a small jar, and sent
it to him, saying, "Give it to my son." 179. Genghis Khan also sent a message to Jamukha: "You
have separated yourself from my father, the khan, out of jealousy and ill will. Which of us gets
up early and who gets to drink from his father's blue cup (airag). I used to get up early and
drink, so you must be jealous. Now you drink as much as you can from your father's blue cup.
How many times will you kill?" (Genghis Khan seems to be referring to his childhood in the
house of Wang Khan.) He also told Genghis Khan and Altan Khuchar: "Do you intend to betray
me by putting up with me? Do you intend to betray me by trickery? Khuchar, because you are
the son of Negun Taiji, when we said, "You become Khan," you did not become Khan. When
Altan, your father, Khotala Khan, ruled over us all, you were in control, so when Altan asked
you to become Khan, you did not agree either.
Since the sons of the Bartan hero are the oldest, I asked Sacha and Taichu to
become khans [they also refused]. Since neither of you can be khans, I have
appointed you as khans and ruled. If you become khans, I will
When the next war comes
I have been wandering in the past,
and I have seen the high blue sky.
Enter into mercy and grace.
If you crush the enemy,
Bring beautiful girls with beautiful faces,
capture beautiful horses, and build a
group for the High Lord. When it's time to
take the forest home
I will squeeze it close. When I
catch a deer, I will squeeze it close.
When I catch a deer, I will squeeze
it until its thighs meet. When I
catch a deer, I will squeeze it until
its heels meet.
Now you are to be loyal friends to my father Khan. You are called to be a traitor. Do not
betray him again. Do not let anyone say that you are a relative of Chauthuri (the title given to
Genghis Khan by Wangin Chansan of the Golden Country. See article 134 for this). Do not let
anyone else settle at the head of the three rivers." 180. Genghis Khan also sent a message to
his brother Tooril: "The reason why you are called a brother is because once upon a time,
Tumbinai and Charkhai Lianhua went to war and captured a slave named Ogda. The son of
the slave Ogda, the slave Subehei, was a slave.
Khokhochu-hirsaan, the son of the slave Subehei. Yehei-hontagar, the son of Khokhochu-
hirsaan, the son of Yehei-hontagar. Tooril, the son of Yehei-hontagar, whose country are you
planning to conquer? Surely, Altan Khuchar of my country will not let anyone know. That is why
you are called younger brother.

A slave to you.
This is my respectful
message.

sent.
181. And Genghis Khan said to Sengum, "I am a son born with a father's robe. You are a
son born naked. You take care of the Khan and me equally, but Sengum, out of
jealousy, has interrupted me and sent me away. Now, do not grieve the Khan's heart or
harden his heart, but go in and out in the morning and evening, rejoicing in your
thoughts and refreshing your mind. Do not forget your old thoughts, and do not grieve
the Khan's heart while he is alive, by becoming Khan. Sengum, send Bilge Behi and
Todoin as ambassadors to me." He also said: "Please send me two ambassadors each
from the Khan, Sengum, Jamuha, Altan, Khuchar, Achig-Shirun, and Khachiun," and he
memorized these words and sent them to Arhai Khasar and Sukhehei. Hearing this,
Sengum said: "While recently my father was cursed as a slaughtering old man, now he
is calling me a good father. Also, while he was cursing me for following the sheep's tail
of the Togtoa shaman, now he is praising me as a good friend and a good friend. I
understand the meaning of this word. It means to fight. There is no doubt about it.
Bilge Behi Todoin and his two sons, fatten up your sons and raise the battle flag." From
there, Arhai Khasar returned, and the sons of Suhehei Jeun, who were in the Wang
Khan's circle, were too discouraged to return and stayed there. Arhai arrived and told
Genghis Khan what they had said.
182. From there, Genghis Khan moved on and landed at Lake Baljun. After landing there,
Tsoostsagaan of Gorlos came to meet him, and the Gorlos followed him. Also, a man named
Hasan of Sartaul (Turkestan), who had bought a thousand sheep from Alahush-digithuria of
Ongud and was buying sable and sable from the people living near the Ergune River, came
riding a white camel and brought his sheep, and while they were watering at Lake Baljun,
Genghis Khan met him.
183. When Genghis Khan landed at Lake Balzhun, Khasar left his mother and three sons, Yegu Yesunhei
Tuhu, with the Van Khan, and went out with a few friends to search for his brother Genghis. He could not
find him by searching for him through the Haraun Jidun ridge, but after eating the skin and tendons, he
finally joined Genghis Khan.
When Khasar arrived, Genghis Khan was delighted and consulted with Van Khan to send
another envoy. He appointed Khaliudar of Jauriday and Chahurkhan of Urian Khan to tell Van
Khan the words of Khasar:
"Hasar, I miss you and your
brother Khan."

My sons and daughters, the Khan is there. If you send a trustworthy person, I will
go to the Khan,” he said, and he also said to Khaliudar and Chakhurkhan: “As soon
as you leave, we will set off and go to the Argal Mountains of Kherlen. You return
there.” He sent Khaliudar and Chakhurkhan away, and sent Jorchidai and Arkhain
as the first scouts, and then Genghis Khan moved through the village and came to
the Argal Mountains of Kherlen.
184. Khaliudar Chahurkhan and Vankhan approached him and said the above words, "The word
of Hasar." At that time, Vankhan and the golden palace (asar) were being built and were getting
married. Hearing the words of Khaliudar Chahurkhan and Vankhan, Vankhan said: "In that case,
Hasar should come." "Let's send Iturgen to a trustworthy person." When Iturgen and Khaliudar
Chakhurkhan arrived at the place called Argal Khohi, where they had agreed, they saw a large
number of people and livestock. The messenger Iturgen [suspected] that he was missing. Since
Khaliudar's horse was fast, he could not catch up with him immediately, but since
Chakhurkhan's horse was slow, he came from behind and shot Iturgen until the golden saddle
of the black horse fell off. Then Khaliudar and Chakhurkhan caught Iturgen and brought him to
Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan did not ask Iturgen for permission. "Take him to Khasar," he said.
When he took him to Khasar, Khasar and Iturgen were cut down without a word. 185. Khaliudar
and Chakhurkhan told Genghis Khan: "Van Khan is not careful, he is building a golden chariot
and getting married. "Now let's ride quickly and attack in the dark of night," (Genghis Khan)
agreed to this, sent Jorchidai and Arhai as the leaders to scout, and then all of them went out at
night and surrounded (Van Khan) at the mouth of the Jer gorge on the Jejer heights. They fought
for three nights and three days, and on the third day they surrendered. Look, Van Khan and
Sengum were gone. Our people did not know that they had escaped at night. It was the hero of
Jurkhin, Khadag, who fought in this way.
Khadag the hero came in and said: "How could I bear to be killed by Tus (his) khan? I
fought for three days and three nights to save his life. Now that he has been captured and
released, we surrender. If you kill me, I will die. If you surrender to Genghis Khan and let
him live, I will give you my strength." Genghis Khan agreed with Khadag the hero's words
and issued an order: "Who can blame a man who does not abandon his khan and fights to
save his life? There is someone who can befriend him," he said, and he gave Khadag the
hero and a hundred people from the Jurhin tribe as servants to Khuildar's daughter in
exchange for Khuildar's death.
"If a son is born from there, let him follow the lineage of the Huildar clan and give it
power. If a daughter is born, her parents may not sell her (to her in-laws) at will.
Their sons and daughters shall be sold after the sons of the Huildar clan," was the
decree. Huildar was the first to open his mouth (to speak his truth), and
Genghis Khan issued a decree: "Because of the efforts of the khan, even his
descendants will receive from the endowment to support orphans."
WHAT WAN KHAN THINKS OF
186. He weakened the Kheri people and divided them into different parts. He gave one hundred
khurykhini as a servant to Tahai, the hero of the Sulddei tribe. Also, Jakha-hambu, the younger brother
of Wang Khan, had two daughters, and Genghis Khan himself took his sister Ibaga, and gave her to his
son Tolui. Therefore, he did not attack the people who were under Jakha-hambu's control, but he
forgave Jakha-hambu, saying, "Let him go like the other island of the chariot."
187. Genghis Khan also gave the golden pavilion where Wang Khan resided, the
golden bowls used by him, the staff he took care of, and the goods he kept near the
king to Badai Khishilig.
"Serving oneself"
Build your own well.
Spend your time
Even in the womb of the fetus
May you both be blessed with
long life.
Going to war to win,
All the loot you've taken
Use it in your life. Go
hunting.
All the deer I killed
"Use it for yourself."
Genghis Khan also issued a decree: "Badai Khishilig, save my life." "I, who have brought about this, have been blessed
in the eternal heavens, have brought about the downfall of the Kheriyd state, and have attained a high position.
May the successors of my foundation, now and in the future, even the descendants of my descendants, forever
remember the benefits these two have brought," the decree was issued.
The Kheriyd country was occupied.

The group was divided and occupied.
The people of Kheriyd were killed and they hid in a place called Abjia Khudger that winter.
188. Wang Khan and Sengum went out together, and at the place called Nehunus in Didig Shahal,
Wang Khan went to the water and met a man named Horisu-bechi, a guard of the Naiman. Wang
Khan said to Horisu-bechi, "I am Wang Khan," but he did not recognize him and did not believe him.
He captured Wang Khan and killed him. Sengum did not go to Nehunus in Didig Shahal, but went
around and went in search of water in the desert. When he saw a group of khulans standing there,
Sengum got off his horse, gave his horse to the khulan, and rode away. Sengum, the khulan, and the
khulan's wife went with them. However, the khulan, the khulan, and the khulan's wife, led Sengum's
horse and turned it upside down, and his wife said:
"When wearing gold,
When eating sweets
I loved and cherished my
beloved, Khokhochu.
But now you
Leaving Han Seong-gum
"Will it be wasted?"
When he was about to leave, Khokhochu said: "Do you want to be Sengum's wife?" When he
asked, the woman said: "Are you calling me a shameless creature like a dog? You should leave
the golden cup. You can only drink water with a jug." Khokhochu threw the golden cup aside
and left in a daze. The hunter Khokhochu returned and went to Genghis Khan:
"He left Senghum in the desert like this," Genghis Khan said, and when he finished
speaking, he ordered: "Only this one will be spared. The other, Khokhochu, who left
his master, is a man who cannot be trusted yet." [Senghum attacked Ashig Balgas
and lived in Tibet, but was persecuted by the local people and came to Kashgar.
There is a story that the lord Kelj there captured Senghum and killed him, and his
wife and children were taken to Genghis Khan. Rashid].
189. The mother of Tayan Khan of the Naimans, Gurbesu, said: "Van Khan, the great khan of old.
Bring his head. If it is, we will worship it." She sent a messenger to Khorisu-bechi, and had Van
Khan's head cut off and brought back, so it was buried on a white hill, and she offered him a bowl of
soup, and she made her daughters-in-law laugh, and she made them laugh, and she made them
laugh, and she put on a bowl of soup, and she raised a glass and offered it to him. While he was
worshipping, Tayan Khan became angry and trampled on the ground. At this, Khugseu said to the
sabra: "How is it right to cut off the head of a dead khan and throw it away? Our dogs began to bark
badly. Inancha Bilge Khan had said before:
"When I was old, my wife
was young. This Tayana was
born by the grace of
heaven. She has a beautiful
body.
My little brown boy, you are a
disgrace to the people.
"Will he be able to take care of it?"
It was. Now
"The black dog began to bark evilly.
Queen Gurbesu
I know everything. You are
Khan Tayan.
There is a gentle person who is gentle.
"They have no knowledge other than hunting," Tayan Khan said, "There are a
few Mongol tribes in the east. The ancient legend says that Wang Khan was
intimidated and killed recently. And do they intend to conquer everyone and
become kings? There are two suns and two moons to make the sky brighter. But
how can there be two khans on earth (why are there two khans on earth?). Now
let's conquer those few Mongols." His mother Gurbesu said to him, "What will
we do? Their Mongols smell like Khankhlah.
What should I do with the ugly clothes I brought?
"It would be better if they were far away. If only the best and best daughters were brought
to the palace and their hands and feet washed, they would be able to milk cows and
sheep," Tayan Khan said, "No matter what they are, we will go to Mongolia and conquer
the Hormsogo Saada."
190. Hearing these words, Khugseu Sabra, the hero, said: "You are talking too much.
Oh, my Torlog Khan, can this be done? Be done," Khugseu Sabra, although he
persuaded him [did not listen to the words]. He sent an envoy named Torbitash to
Alahush-digithuri of the Ongud province and said: "A few Mongol tribes from this
eastern region have attacked. You go as your right hand. I will join you here and
together we will seize those few Mongol horomsogs." At that word, Alahush-digithuri
said: "I cannot be your right hand," and sent an envoy named Yu-Hunan to Genghis
Khan and said: "Tayan Khan of the Naimans, let me seize your horomsogs. When you
asked me to be your right hand, I did not agree. Now I know this reason and sent you
to be careful. You take your horoms from the enemy." At that time, Genghis Khan was
hunting in the Temen Kheer and hunting in the Tulkhincheud, when the messenger
sent by Alahush-digithuri, Yu-Hunan, came and told him. Hearing this news, they also
consulted at the hunting ground, saying, "What to do?" Many people said, "Our herd is
thin. Now there is no way [in the fall, let's fight after the herd is fat. Rashid]", but
Otchigin said, "How can we use the excuse that the herd is thin? My horses are fat.
Can we sit still after hearing such news? [Having heard such news, let's immediately
go to battle. If we sit still and Tayan Khan is captured, won't this place be called the
Mongols and Tayan Khan occupied? After the battle, only heaven knows whether they
will win or we will win. Rashid.]" Belgutei said,
"While I was alive
What's the point of living if you
lose your golden moment?
Holding a bow and arrow
Instead of leaving Yasa in the field, holding on to
the moment that is holding back,
Dear good death
Is it possible to be a
man? Eight countries
With a vast territory
There are many citizens.
They boasted that they were rich
in horses and cattle.
I am saying this.
But in this case...
If we attack,
Occupy the territory
When the bow and arrow are seized
No problem.
If we attack now, we won't be able to collect
many horses. It's possible that there won't be
enough left. The horde won't be able to carry
the goods home.
It's definitely not a good idea to throw it away.
Many nationalities are behind it.
Sneaking into the forest
Not to be confused by accident.
"Now, I can't just sit back and
listen to these words. Let's go to
war all over the world."
191. Genghis Khan agreed to this word of the Belgutai prince, and then he dismounted and
moved from Abjia Khudger, and went to a place called Heltgii Khad in the Ornu of the
Khalkh River, where he dismounted and counted his army. Genghis Khan divided his army
and appointed a thousand-year prince, a hundred-year prince, a ten-year prince, and [great]
cherbi. He appointed these six cherbi officials there: Dodai cherbi, Dogolhu cherbi, Oelen
cherbi, Tolun cherbi, Bucharan cherbi, and Suikhetu cherbi. Having divided his troops into
ten and one hundred thousand, he also specially appointed eighty night guards, seventy
guards, and guards of honor, including the most learned and physically fit among the
princes of the thousand, the sons of the princes of the hundred, and the sons of the free
people. Genghis Khan there befriended Arkhai Khasar and said, "Let a thousand good
heroes be chosen! Let them go and fight before me on the day of battle! Let them be my
guard on the day of battle!" He also said, "Let the seventy guards be led by Oelen Cherbi! Let
them advise with Hudus-Khalchin!"
192. And Genghis Khan decreed: "The archers (bowmen), the cooks, the
gatekeepers, and the gatekeepers shall take turns every day in performing their
duties, and they shall be laid down before the sun sets."
Let them hand it over to the people and go out to the camp themselves to spend the night! Let the
guards stand at the door in shifts at night and keep watch around the house! As soon as we have
eaten breakfast, the guards and guards will come and take over from the guards, and take up their
duties as before, and keep watch! After three days and three nights of traveling, let them spend the
night (resting)! "Let the forty-four soldiers take turns taking turns!" was the order. Then, having
finished distributing his troops by the thousands, he appointed Cherbi princes, appointed eighty
princes, seventy torguds, and khishikten, and appointed Arkhai Khasar as the leader of the best
warriors, and set out from the place called Heltgii Khad of Or Nug on the Khalkh Gol to fight against
the Naiman nation. [At that time, Togtoa of Mergid, one of the princes of the Khereid aimag, who had
come to the aid of Alin Taij, the Oird aimag led by Khutug Bekhi, Jamuha of the Jajirdai tribe, and the
four Tatar, Khatahin, and Saljiud aimags had all joined the Naiman nation. Rashid].
193. On the sixteenth day of the first month of summer in the year of the Rat (1204), he
raised his banner and sent Zev Kublai and his men to Kherlen as scouts. They went and
reached the Saar steppe and met the Naiman guard at the head of Khankharkhan
(Khangai-khan). They fought each other, and our guard captured a gray horse with a
saddle from the Naiman guard. The Naiman guard captured the horse and said, "It is a
Mongolian horse." Our army reached the Saar steppe and dismounted, asking, "What
now?" When Dodai Cherbi discussed this, he told Genghis Khan: "Our army is small and
we are tired on the road. Therefore, let us stay here for a long time and fill our
stomachs. Let us spread out on the Saar steppe and light five fires per night for every
living person. There are eight people. But their Khan is a man who has never been out
of the house. While we are threatening them with fire, our stomachs will be full. When
we have rested and filled our stomachs, can we attack the Naiman guard and drive out
the main force and enter their camp?" When he said this, Genghis Khan agreed and
gave an order: "Then light the fires." The soldiers spread out on the Saar steppe and
light five fires per living person. The Naiman guard, the head of the Khanhar Khan, saw
many fires at night and said, "Isn't it true that the Mongols are few? There are more
fires than the stars," and Tayan Khan sent a gray horse with a bad saddle that he had
built. Tayan Khan also reported: "The Mongol troops have filled the Saar steppe. It
seems that they are coming in like water that flows every day. There are more fires than
the stars. (Do they appear in the high mountains during the day? There are more fires
like the stars at night)."
194. When this message of the guard arrived, Tayan Khan and Khangai were in the water. Tayan Khan
took this message and sent it to his son Khuchulug Khan, saying: "The Mongol army is thin. It is said that
there are many fires burning from the stars. The Mongols are many. Now we,
Black and evil Mongols
Once you start to get itchy, it
will be hard to break.
Even if you stab your cheek
He doesn't blink his eyes, even
though his black blood flows,
he never turns back.
The Mongols are very strict.
Don't fight too much.
Now the Mongolian army is thin. If we move our country beyond Altai, organize our
army, incite the Mongols, and drag them to the cradle of Altai with dogs, our army will
be fat and will be exhausted. The Mongolian army will become even thinner and more
exhausted. At that time, we will attack them from the front." He sent. Hearing that,
Khuchulug Khan said: "Tayan Khan has lost his heart like a mother (bad mother) and
said such words. Where will the Mongols be? The majority of the Mongols, following
Jamukh, are here with us.
Not far from the place where pregnant
women urinate
The little calf has not left the
pasture.
"Mother Tayan lost her heart
and said these words," said
Father Tayankhan.
They sent an envoy to attack
and insult Eldever.
Hearing this insulting and cursed word, Tayan Khan said:
"Your son is strong."
There is much pride in being strong,
but when it comes to fighting,
He'll probably get discouraged before he gets
older. He's so stubborn.
Let the enemy be defeated!
Once the fight begins
We just can't get along.
". Hearing those words, the great lord after Tayan Khan, Horisu-bechi, said:
"Inancha, Bilge Khan, your father
To an equal enemy
No gear showing.
On the day of battle
I have never looked back.
"Why should you lose heart today for tomorrow? If you knew that your heart would be so
broken, would you bring your queen mother Gurbes and command the army? Poor Khugseu
Sabra has become a hero and the army has been defeated. It will be the Mongols' fortune. We
will be victorious. Oh, the wicked Tayan, you are a worthless man," he said, turning around and
leaving.
195. Tayan Khan became angry and said to him: "The soul that dies and the body that suffers are all the same.
"Yes. If so, let's fight," said Khachir, setting off from the water, went to Tamir, crossed the Orkhon, crossed
the eastern edge of the Nakhu River, and reached a place called Tsakhir Mogod. When he reached a place
called Tsakhir Mogod, Genghis Khan's guard saw him and said, "Beware of the eight." Hearing this,
Genghis Khan gave an order: "The more the more the loss. The less the loss." He rode against them (from
the south), drove off their guard, and when he had assembled his army, he fought through the Khargana
pass.
"Let's fight from a lake position
and attack with a chisel."
Then Genghis Khan himself went to Magnai and ordered his main forces to Khasar.
Otchigin was in charge of the preparations.
Naiman, returning from Tsakhir Mogod, was in a hut at the foot of the mountain in the
Nahu Valley. Then our guard chased the Naiman's guard and reached his main force in
the Nahu Valley. Tayan Khan saw him and asked Jamukha, who had come to fight with
the Naiman: "What kind of people are these wolf-like raiders who are breaking into a
flock of sheep and chasing them even to their city?" Jamukha said: "My friend Temujin,
they feed four dogs with human flesh and tie them to chains. Now those four dogs are
chasing our guard.
The iron forehead of the shirmen
The tattoo has a sharp tongue.
With a heart of steel
The stake has a pointed tip.
Four mad dogs,
To slaughter a large number of animals
Escape from the iron chains
To eat right away
Greedy, fearless, drinking from
the dew
Cooking with saliva
Riding on the wind
Zev, who is a husband who is a
hindrance, and Kublai, who is leading
Zelme and Subedei were
raised by Temujin's friends.
Those four dogs
"He has arrived with a desire"
Tayan Khan said: "Then let's stay away from those evil creatures," and he retreated and
climbed the mountain. And seeing the people jumping up and down behind them,
Tayan Khan asked Jamukh:
"The foal that was laid early
Suckling mother's milk
Jumping around like a
galloping horse
How many people are these?
"Does the venerable Jamuha
know?" Jamuha said, "To
scare the armed man
Rust destroys equipment.
Rejecting the swordsman
The more the less.
They are noble and brave. They
are brave and brave.
"When the battle approaches,
Bayarlan will jump forward."
From there, Tayan Khan said: "Then let's stay away from that evil one," and
retreated and climbed the mountain. "And who are those who are coming after
them like hungry birds?" Tayan Khan asked, and Jamuha replied:
"The one coming from
behind is Temujin, and he
is Khan Temujin."
All over my body
No room for snoring
Wearing a metal brace
No breaks in typing.
Wearing a suit of armor
Like a hungry bird
I am afraid, I am afraid.
Like an angry beast.
I'm scared to move forward.
"Didn't it say that once you see Mongolia, you won't leave a single inch of it [to divide it up
and conquer it]?" "Now you see," he said. Hearing these words, Tayan Khan said: "Oh,
then let's climb up to the mouth of this mountain." They climbed the mountain for a long
time, and Tayan Khan asked Jamukh: "And who is that huge creature coming from
behind?" Jamukh said:
"Dear Queen Oelun,
Fed on human flesh
The Mighty Khasar
He is the son.
Strong enough to not bend even
when pulled by three bulls
Gunjin eats the cow.
With an insatiable stomach
How many miles are there?
Wearing chain mail
The fierce Khasar
Who is afraid to eat everything?
When a person with a disability is
swallowed by a snake
That little Khasar
It is said that it does not stick to the
throat. It is said that it is a living person.
Grab it and swallow it.
The danger is that surprise.
It won't stick in your mouth.
The anger is very strong.
Grab the arrow that goes forward.
When you shoot,
Even people beyond the mountains
are attracted to the Uul soum.
The sun will rise and fall. The velvet
will touch the ground.
Grab your abstract arrow.
When shooting towards the gas
Even the people beyond the
border are in that same area.
They will be crushed and many will die. If you
shoot them with a large arrow,
Nine hundred arrows shoot from the ground,
and the Tatu shoots from the sky.
Not a human being like a man who shoots five
hundred arrows into the ground
Man-eating monster
The mighty Khasar
"I'm coming and going."
Then Tayan Khan said: "Then let us take refuge in a high mountain, let us climb up." He
climbed further up the mountain. Then Tayan Khan asked Jamukh: Who is coming after him?
Then, Jamuha said:
"He is the youngest son of the
mother of Oelun, Otchigin.
Because of his noble lineage,
I go to bed early but
A brave and courageous person
Because he is the youngest son.
I get up in the evening, but
A strong man
When the battle rages, he
does not stay in his home.
Hero Otchigin will go"
"Then let's go to the top of the mountain," said Tayan Khan.
196. Jamuha, Tayan Khan, having said these words, separated from the eight, and sent a
messenger to Genghis Khan to say:
"Tayan Khan, afraid of you, has
retreated into the Taiga Mountains. He
is terrified and has lost consciousness.
He is climbing the mountain for
refuge. Temujin, you must be strong.
They are panicking and falling short.
When he looks at his face, he is
powerless to resist.
"We and our comrades have separated from the eight." Genghis Khan, at sunset,
surrounded the Nakhu mountain and spent the night. That night, the eight were afraid of
falling, and the Nakhu fell from the mountain, crushing each other like fallen logs, and died.
The next day, Tayan Khan was defeated. [Tayan Khan was seriously wounded and died
immediately. Rashid]. Since Khukhulg Khan was isolated, he fell with a small number of
people, reached the Tamir River, was overtaken by the army that had gathered, and fought
to hold the fortress, but he could not resist, and went further and fell [to his uncle Buyrun
Khan]. He defeated the Naiman people in the Altai Mountains and brought them all under
his control. [Jamukha fell to the west.] The Jadaran, Khatagin, Saljiud, Durven, and Taichung,
who had followed Jamukh, followed Genghis Khan there. Genghis Khan brought Taya's
mother, Queen Gurbesu, and said: "Do you know that Mongols smell bad? Why have you
come here now?" Genghis Khan took her himself. [A man from Taya's province was missing.
Khasar asked to capture him alive, so Batu captured him alive. Look, there was a seal on his
lap. Khasar said: "Where are you going with this thing when all your troops from all your
provinces are following you?" The man said: "I will guard my body and my place of
command until I die. I wanted to deliver this seal to its former owner. I was caught by
chance." Khasar said: "Which tribe are you from, and what was your rank?" The man said: "I
am originally from the Uyghur land. My name is Tatatunga. My master gave me this seal
and ordered me to issue and issue documents. Khasar also asked: "What is this seal used
for?" Tatatunga said: "Choose a good person and use it for any task to issue decrees."
Khasar praised him and told Temujin that he was a fair and honest man, and gave the seal
to Tatatunga to use for any letter. Khasar took Tatatunga as his teacher and taught him
many things, including writing, law, military strategy, and so on, and he soon learned the
meaning of writing. It is found in the 23rd chapter of Mergen Gege's Golden Book.]
197. In the autumn of the year of the mouse, Genghis Khan fought with the Mergid chieftain Togtoa at the place
called the Black Peak, defeated Togtoa and drove him out, and took many of the Mergid chieftains to the place
called the Saar Kheer. Togtoa, Hudu, and Chuluun took two sons and a few people with them and left. [Hudu and
Chuluun's wives were given to Genghis Khan's son Ögedei]. When the Mergid people were conquered, a man
named Dayr-Usun, the leader of the Mergids, [saying that he did not want to fight], brought his daughter Khula to
Genghis Khan to show her,
When Dayr-Usun met the Naya prince of Baariday and said, "I am going to
show this girl to Genghis Khan," Naya prince said, "We will take your daughter
with us. If you go alone, the soldiers who happened to be there at such a time
of trouble will harm you and your daughter, so let's go together. You wait for
me for three days." From there, Naya prince Dayr-Usun and Khula took Khula to
Genghis Khan. When Genghis Khan heard that Naya prince had kept Khula at
home for three days, he was very angry and asked him loudly, "Why did you
keep Khula at home?" and was about to punish him, Khula said, "This is what
Naya prince told me: "
"I am Genghis Khan's great prince. Let's go to the king together. On the way, the
soldiers may get confused," he persuaded. If Naya Lord does not meet and help, we
will be captured by the intermediate soldiers and become their prey. Hey, I have met
this Naya. Now, instead of asking this Naya Lord, if the king allows, let me examine
my body, which is given by heaven and born of my parents." And Naya Lord said:
"The owner of all"
Genghis Khan you
Other than loving and respecting
I have no black votes. I was
captured by a foreign country.
Beautiful horses with beautiful
faces and good hearts
The king is yours, look at
him without any harm.
It is kept without any hesitation. There
is no other feeling than this.
Did you really miss it?
If something has been done
"I have no regrets about dying."
Genghis Khan agreed with Khulna Khatan's words and tested her immediately that day. Since
Khulna Khatan's words were true, Genghis Khan pardoned Khulna Khatan. Since Naya Noyon's
words also turned out to be true, he pardoned her, saying, "He is a man of truth and honesty.
Let him do great deeds."
LOW ALTITUDE AND OVERCOME OF THE DAY
198. The Mergids captured the city, and Togtoa Bekh's eldest son, Hudu's queen,
Tohi, and Durgene, gave Durgene to Ogedei Khan there. Some of the Mergids
invaded, and went to Taihal Shiveen and fortified it. There Genghis Khan issued an
order: "Chimbai, son of Sorkhon-shar, take the left-hand army and besiege the
fortified Mergids."
Genghis Khan, who had only a few men, including his sons Hudu and Chuluun, wintered in the
Altai Mountains and crossed the Arai Pass in the spring of the Year of the Ox (1205).
In the summer of 1590, Khüqlüg Khan of the Naimans met with Togtoa of the Mergids, who had lost his
country and was short of men, and they were organizing their army together at a place called Bukhderme
on the Erchis River. When Genghis Khan arrived and fought, Togtoa was shot by a wild arrow and died
there. His sons did not try to bury his body and cut off his head and went away. From there, the Naimans
and Mergids could not fight together and were short of men, and when they crossed the Erchis River,
most of them drowned. The Naimans and Mergids, with a small number of men, separated after crossing
the Erchis. Khüqlüg Khan of the Naimans attacked the Uyghurs, Kharlugi, and joined the Gur Khan of the
Black Chinese on the Chui River in the Sartaul area. The sons of Togtoa of the Mergids, led by Hudu, Gal,
and Chuluun, attacked the Mergids, Khanlins, and Hipchags.
From there, Genghis Khan returned, crossed the Aray pass, and descended to his mountain palace. He
captured the Mergids who were hiding in Chimbai and Taihal. Genghis Khan issued an edict, and killed the
Mergids, and the rest were scattered and plundered by his soldiers. Also, when the Mergids who had
previously followed him, Aurag (the rear or mountain), who had rebelled from the palace, the guides who
were in the palace suppressed them. There, Genghis Khan issued an edict, saying: "We wanted to keep
them together. But they betrayed us," and distributed the Mergids to the end. 199. Also in the year of the
Ox, Genghis Khan issued an edict, and had Subedei build an iron chariot and sent Togtoa's sons, Hudu,
Gal, and Chuluun, to collect them. He gave Subedei the following edict:
"Urshit Togtoa"
Betrayed sons
Like a glutton
Lost consciousness
Like a wounded deer
Shantran Mohoj
Keep shooting back.
It was a mistake.
The exiled Hoodoo and the
Stones have wings to fly.
If you fly in the blue sky
You are a hero.
Become a falcon to kill
Go and catch them!
The sons of the evil Togtoa
Become a foolish marmot
If you fall into a blind hole
With Sube, the perfect hero
Iron becomes iron
Dig deep! The descendants
of the ostriches
Become a barbed fish
If you enter the wide ocean
You are a stonemason.
Fat becomes a lump
Hang on tight!
You are a hero.
Overcoming the high pass
Crossing the wide river
To suppress the avengers

Crossing the length of the water
When reaching the far side of the land
I miss my riding horse.
Save your food.
Be careful in advance! If
you hurt your horse,
Shut up, it'll be late.
If you eat any food
It's too late to save money. On
that distant road
There are many deer to
hunt. Keep hunting.
Don't forget the long way,
as a food supplement
Take as much as you can. If you
are lucky, you will be free.
On a simple journey
Male military horses
Untie the reins of the saddle, grasp

If you take the sons of Gait
Togtoa into your hands,
"Don't bring them in.

the order.
To the brave Subedei
Genghis also said:
"You go now."
Kill the Chivelt Mergids.
In my youth they
attacked me often.
God bless us.
Bultuulan was making me nervous.
Those idiots are so annoying.
I swear today too.
Another direction is missing.
Reaching the end of the line
Go to the bottom of the abyss
"Take revenge!" he said, using
the Iron Chariot to send the
faithful Subedei to the Year of
the Ox.
"Undercover"
Remember clearly
Go far away.
Think about it.
If you trust us,
May the heavens bless you.
"Will support"
When the hero Subedei rode,
the order was given.
200. After the conquest of the Nayman Mergids, Jamuha, who was with Nayman, lost his country and
wandered with five companions. He went to the Tanlu (Tagna) mountain and killed a wild boar and
ate it. Jamuha said to his companions: "Whose sons are killing wild boars today and eating them like
this?" While they were eating the meat of the wild boar, his five companions took Jamuha by the hand
and brought him to Genghis Khan. Jamuha was captured by his companions and told Genghis Khan:
"Black crow"
Dirty duck
It's time to build.
Look at the slave.
To the Khan
It was time to attack.
My friend, the king
Love and forgive.
Brown hair
The merganser
It's time to build.
Slave servant
Think about it.
He stood up and attacked.
My friend Bogd
"Think about it."
At Jamukh's words, Genghis Khan issued an order: "How can a king leave a man who has attacked
his master? Who can befriend such a man? The king must destroy the people who have attacked
his master, even their descendants." Then he killed the people who had attacked him before
Jamukh's eyes.
Genghis Khan, the order to tell Jamukh:
"Now we both
Let's get closer and be friends.
As of today, you
As an isolated island
There's no other idea.
Let's get together.
Mutual friendship
Remind me of what I forgot.
Let's wake up from sleep.
By another way
Although gone
My dear good husband, you
are the same.
To fight with death
When the day comes
Dear heart
You're in pain.
By the way to class
Although gone
My good friend, you
are the same.
Fighting fiercely
When the day comes
Lungs, heart.
It hurts, you.
To give a few examples:
We have a country in Khareid.
To the bald eagle
When it's time to get married
Tooril Khan's idea
Tell us clearly.
It helped a lot.
And Eight Countries
Threaten to death with words
It's scary to say it out loud.
Report any situation
"It was a great help," he said.
201. Jamuha said:
"In the distant past
Enkhriy in his childhood
The two became very close friends in the
valley of Khorkhuna and Jubur.
Khan and you are welcome.
Become a dear friend
Eating indigestible food,
covered with a blanket
I remember one thought. Being chased
by a stranger, being carried away by
the word of death.
Being hurt by someone else, being
hurt by someone else's words
From you, friend of the king.
After parting ways, I
The skin of your dark face
Like a swindler
Yours, my friend.
From seeing a warm face
I was suffering from exhaustion.
Discussed endlessly
Remember the old words
It's like making your red
face sick by scratching it.
My dear friend
From seeing a wise face
He retreated.
My friend, I am
Lovingly and lovingly
Let's get along.
When it's time to get married
I'm not sure.
You are Temujin.
The country of Tumen
To the center
Foreign country
Co-rule
Most occupied
As king
Around the world
When ready
I'm useless.
What to do?
Dark night
It's a dream.
Holy day
Become a victim
King and friend
I will suffer.
Your lice are annoying.
The thorns of your tongue
I will.
In the words of Ataat
Separated from you
Tired, I
Within this age
Dear friend,
The name Enkhriy is famous.
Taken from the rising sun
Until the setting sun
It was sung throughout the country.
A bright hero to you.
Setsen was born.
To you brave hero
The scholarly brothers were
born. Seventy-three knights
The blacksmith has friends.
Dalai Genghis to you
I was oppressed and perished, and I was
separated from my parents.
The orphan body is late.
No good husband to trust
I have no good brothers.
More missing words
The great legend has a wife.
Because it was like that.
Destined by the heavenly father
Temujin has defeated you, I,
my friend, surrender my life to
you, and your sacred heart will
rest in peace.
It will be sunny.
And you are the one who is in charge.
Without spilling blood
Please forgive me.
My bones, which will die, will lie
in the world of procreation.
Forever existing
The family of a faithful friend
May you be blessed and sustained,
let us offer this blessing.
A different kind of me
High-born friend
The hump was crushed by the crest.
My wish
I will not forget.
Always
Keep it up!
"Now, let me be crowned!" Hearing these words, Genghis Khan said:
"But my friend Jamuha
Class breaks down
Remember the poison of jealousy.
The word suicide
I didn't say anything.
Can be repaired, but
I'm not trying to fix it. I'll
see if I can figure it out.
A man of high rank, as if it
were not his time to die
Don't cause unnecessary harm.
To harm a person's life
A good reason is needed.
"To explain this, do you remember that when Jochi Dharmala and Taichar were robbing each
other of their horses, you, my friend Jamuha, behaved badly and mischievously, fought at the
place called Dalan Baljhuud, and frightened me by the Zeeren's persecution? Now, if we want to
be friends again, we will not allow it. Tell me that I love your life, but I am forced to. Now,
according to your words, I will heal you without shedding blood, and your body will not be
exposed, and I will bury you with honor," the order was given. Jamuha was killed there and
buried.
201. Then the Esgii Tuurgatan nation became peaceful and just, and in the year of the tiger (1206) they
gathered at the head of the Onon River, raised their nine-legged white banner, and bestowed the title of
Genghis Khan (Dalai Khan) on Temujin. There they gave Mukhulay the title of Goo Van (king of the
country). They sent Zevi to summon the Naiman Khüqulug Khan. After uniting the Mongol nation,
Genghis Khan issued a decree:
202. "My dear comrades who worked tirelessly to establish politics, who have made their former
distinguished comrades into nobles, have been honored and honored by the nobles of the
millennium."

95. Alkhushdigid khuri tulun of the Ongs, five thousand Ongs, in addition to the forest
citizens, the thousand princes of Mongolia appointed by Genghis Khan became ninety-five
thousand princes.
203. Genghis Khan, along with his sons-in-law, appointed these ninety-five thousand
princes and issued an order among them: "Let us give our comrades another command.
Send in the other princes, such as Boorchi and Mukhulai." He said to Shigihutu, who was
among them, "Invite them." Shigihutu said:
"Boorchi and Mukhulai"
Ready from us
Very helpful
Did you work harder?
To celebrate
From them I
Helping less
Did you work hard?
From the cradle, I
Leaning on your high threshold, I
have such a big beard.
Until the old man turned gray
I can't think of anything else.
I have been in your mercy since my
childhood. I have leaned on your
golden threshold, and I have a
beard in my mouth.
Until old age
Al tried his best, without
any difficulty.
Lay down at your feet.
Cover yourself with a blanket.
Like a boy
Raised me,
Lay down next to me.
Cover yourself with your coat.
Like a younger brother
Raised and raised.
What kind of favor will you give me now?" Genghis Khan said to Shigihutug: "Aren't you my
sixth brother? I will give you a share of the property like my own brothers. And I will consider
the merits you have brought and spare you nine misfortunes." The decree was issued. "With
the blessing of the eternal heaven, while you serve the country, you will be the eyes to see
and the ears to hear. Give our mothers and brothers and sons a share from the felt tuurgat,
and divide the people who belong to you from the folded uttan. No one can change your
word." He also ordered Shigihutug to be the supreme judge of the whole country, saying,
"Punish theft in all the country, suppress lies, kill those who should be killed, and punish
those who should be punished." He also ordered, "Divide the property of the whole country,
punish the lawsuits, and record them in the blue book. "Consult me and let Shigihutu write
down the punishment in blue on white paper and let no one change it forever, even for
posterity." Shigihutu said, "How can a petitioner like me, a younger brother of the king,
receive a share of the property? If the king grants permission, I will take it from the citizens of
the ruined city." He replied, "You yourself will register this case and punish it, so you will
know and do it yourself." Shigihutu himself received permission from the king and left,
inviting the nobles led by Boorchi and Muhulai.
204. From there, Genghis Khan gave an order to Mengli's father: "Your benevolent virtues,
which were born with birth and grew with growth, have brought you so much. I must mention
that if I were to spend the night at Mengli's father's house on the way to visit Wang Khan and
Sengum, and you had not persuaded me, I would have drowned in the black water or been
burned to death in the hot fire. Remembering that, I will place you on this noble seat every
year and give you a reward that will not fail every month, and I will continue to bless you
forever, even to your descendants."
205. And Genghis Khan said to the Boorchid: "When I was young, I lost my eight yellow horses and met
you on the road for three days. You went home to help me who was wandering in the wilderness, and
without telling your father, you left me in the field with a mare's yoke, and you saddled my beloved
horse, and gave me the dark-skinned horse, and you yourself rode your own fast horse, and left your
horse without a master, and you hurriedly went with me to hunt the robbers for three days. When we
reached the area where my yellow horses were robbed, you drove out the yellow horses that were on
the outskirts of the surrounding houses and brought them back. You are the only son of the rich Nahu,
and what did you know that you made friends with me? You made friends with a true and kind heart.
After that, I kept thinking of you and when I sent Belgute to make friends, you rode your beloved horse
and rode a brown horse. came to you yourself. When the three Mergids attacked us and besieged
Burkhan Khaldun three times, you were besieged with us. And after that, when Dalan Nemurged
fought with the Tatars, it rained day and night. That night, you covered me with your cloak to let me
sleep, and when you stood all night without letting the rain fall on me, you changed your foot only
once. The sign of a knight
This is it. What other work of yours can I mention? Boorchi and Mukhulai, you have allowed and
supported my good deeds, stopped my bad deeds, and brought me to this great settlement. Now, let us
put you above all others, and let us not discuss the punishment for the nine accidents that have
occurred. Boorchi, know and rule the people of the Altai region on the right hand side," the order was
given.
206. And Genghis Khan gave an order to Mukhulai: "When Hotala Khan stopped at the foot of
the saglagar tree in the valley of Horhunag-jubur, where he was dancing, Mukhulai
remembered the words of the heavenly tsar (suld), so I (Mukhulai's father) remembered Gun
Gu and fought with Mukhulai. Now, since I have settled in a great place, I will make Mukhulai
the great king of the country and the dynasty for generations to come," and he gave him the
title of great king. "Muhulai, great king, know the people of the left-hand Haraun-jidun area,"
the order was given.
207. Genghis Khan, in his speech to the Horde:
"From a young age,
Until now
Become a good husband
Wet together in the wet
Chilling together in the cold
Raise your strength, you
In the distant past
You are a fortune teller.
The prophetic word
Everything fits perfectly.
If by the power of heaven's mercy,
it will be done as it is.
You asked for thirty
wives.
Now that you have fulfilled your word, choose good wives and beautiful women from the country you
have conquered." The order was also issued: "Adargin's chinos, toolis, and telengs, together with
three thousand barins, together with Tahai Ashig, shall unite the province and make it a thousand
citizens, and let Horchi rule over it, possess and inhabit the land along the Erchis River up to the
forest citizens, and also lead the thousand forest citizens." The order was issued: "The forest citizens
may not move from one place to another without the permission of the Horchi. Those who violate the
word of the Horchi shall be punished."
208. And Genghis Khan said to Jorchidai: "If you mention the great service you have rendered, when
the Kheriyd and Kharhalzan tribes were to fight fiercely, you said that Huildar and Anda would lead
the fight, but you were the one who did the real thing. Jorchidai attacked and defeated the thousands
of soldiers and best soldiers of Jurhin, Tubegen, Dungayd, and Khorishiremun, and reached a great
main force, wounding the cheek of Sengum with an arrow, opening the door to eternal victory in
heaven. If Sengum had not been wounded, we do not know what would have happened. Jorchidai,
this is the great service you have rendered. When we left there and moved to the Khalkh River,
Jorchidai remembered you as a high mountain shelter. From there, we went down to Lake Baljun to
drink. Note, from Lake Baljun, Jorchidai was sent to Kheriyd as a guide (alkhinch). Heaven
With the help of the land, we subdued the Kheraid people. Because the main Kheraid country was
divided and oppressed, the eight and Mergids who followed them were discouraged and could not
fight. While the Mergids and the eight were scattered, Jakha-khambu of Kheraid, for the reason of
following his two daughters, took his subjects with him. However, since he was hostile, Jorchidai
asked, and after he had fled, he captured Jakha-khambu by trickery and plundered him. He killed
and occupied the country of Jakha-khambu. This is another advantage of Jorchidai.
Day of the Dead
I will not love my life.
Deliver the goods
Battle day
Don't lose your place.
Because of your heroic efforts
Genghis Khan gave his wife Ibaga to Jorchidai and said to Ibaga:
"Your virginity is not rejected. Your
sacred beauty is not tarnished, [Not
that your feet are dirty, Not that your
sweat smells, A.to] Warm your heart
Covered feet
Your queen, you.
In the service of the great state
To the hardworking Jorchidai
Thus it became a blessing.
At the time of the crisis
Becoming Khalkh,
A divided country
Give together.
In a knife fight
Become an armor
A divided country
Confiscated
"I have given you to repay the kindness of Jorchidai and to celebrate his merit. From now on,
those who succeed to the throne from my family, thinking of the manners of repaying such a
favor, and without changing my words, do not interrupt the foundation (fame) of Ibag from
generation to generation," was the decree. And Genghis Khan said to Ibag: "Your father Jaha-
khambu, gave you two hundred people as a dowry, along with the two cooks Ashig-Tumur and
Alchig. Now, when you go to the country, as a memorial, give me one hundred people from the
dowry, including the cook Ashig-Tumur. "Give it to me together," he said. Then Genghis Khan said
to Jorchidai: "Ibaga Queen, give it to you." "You shall know and rule over your four thousand
descendants," the decree was given.
THE FORMATION OF THE SHADAR KHIGHIT ARMY
209. And Genghis Khan said to Kublai: "You have twisted the necks of the strong
and trampled the buttocks of the wrestlers. Now Kublai, Zelme, Zev, and Subedei,
you four are faithful companions like good dogs. Wherever I send you,
Reaching the place called Khur,
he smashed the Khur stone,
attacked the place called Khald,
smashed the Khad stone, and
shattered the Tsegee stone.
Until the country of Ceeli is destroyed
They went on a killing spree.
"If you send your four dogs, Khuvilai, Zelme, Zev, and Subeedei, to their destination,
and take your four knights, Boorchi, Mukhulai, Borokhul, and Chuluun, with you, and on
the day of the attack, first go down and lead the Mangud army, led by Jorchidai and
Khuildar, then my mind will be at ease." "Khuvilai, you will be in charge of all military
affairs," he said. Also, because Bitan is very stubborn, I did not condemn him and made
him the commander of a thousand. You should train him. He will agree with you and
lead a thousand. We will see what Bitan will be like in the future."
210. And Genghis Khan said to Hunan:
"Boorchi and Muhulai chiefs, and Doday Dogolhu chief Cherbi! This
Hunan,
Dark night
Become a wolf to attack.
Holy day
It's like a crow.
Will not stay if moved
I won't move if I stay.
Always follow me.
To a foreign enemy
Give a warm face
Not responding
To the one who is in need.
Help me.
They don't behave differently.
"Consult with the Hunan Hohochos and the two and do all the work," the order was
given. "My son's brother is Juchi. Hunan, Geniges will lead the clan and rule, and my son
Juchi will be the lord of the people," the order was given. "These four, Hunan Hohochos,
Degei, and Old Usun, do not hide what they see, speak the truth, do not suppress what
they know, and make what they hear be heard."
211. And Genghis Khan said to Zelmed: "Old Jarchiuday, carrying his little son with him, the
god came down from the Khaldun and gave me the Bulgan cradle at the time of my birth.
Since then, I have been a slave of the khan and the property of the household, and have been
of great benefit to this day. My virtuous husband, born in the Bulgan cradle, my beloved
husband Zelmed, with whom I was born and raised as a spouse, will not condemn you for
causing nine accidents." The decree was made.
212. And Genghis Khan said to Tolund: "You ruled a thousand independent of your father. When you
conquered and established the country, you worked hard as a wingman for your father, and therefore
you received the title of Cherbi. Now, make the citizens you have brought into your country a thousand,
and rule in consultation with Turukhan." The decree was given.
213. And Genghis Khan said to Ungur Khauri: "You, Ungur, son of Mengitu Khan, have gathered together the three
provinces of Tohur, the five provinces of Targu, the Qingshi, and the Baya, and have formed a single circle.
Don't get lost in the fog.
The war of the blizzards is not
separated, we get wet together
Chilling together in the cold
You're gone.
What kind of alms will you take now?" Ungur said: "If you choose alms, all the rich
brothers are scattered. If the king rules, I will gather my rich brothers and rule." He
said: "Yes, Bayad, gather your brothers and rule a thousand!" He ordered. Genghis
Khan also ordered: "Borokhul Ungur, you and I will become distributors and distribute
food to the right and left, provide accommodation to the people on the right, and
distribute food to the people on the left in a reasonable manner. My throat will be
opened and my heart will be relieved." Ungur and Borohul rode (on horseback) and
prepared food for many people, prepared food for the right and left of the tent, and
said, "You two, sit in the center with Tolun and distribute food."
214. And Genghis Khan said to Borohul: "My mother, Shigihutu, Borohul, Huchu, and Hohochu,
you four, have fled from the land of the exiled people.
Found in the countryside
Cradling your feet
Nurturing and nurturing
Pulling you by the neck
To the level of a human being
Pull it from your pocket.
To be put in the male category
The boys raised us to be their husbands. You have been very responsible for the kindness my
mother has given me. Borohul has become my husband.
Riding on a fast journey
It happened on a rainy night.
Without food or drink
Not long ago, I spent an empty night
in a war of urgency.
No matter what difficulties arise, the
soup is interrupted.
I wasn't starving.
The enemy who harmed my
grandfather, who weakened the
Tatars, took revenge.
Scalloped scallops
That citizen
When the chariot wheel is level with the
wheel, and the one with the taller back is
dragged and killed
The Tatar Khargil Zhar, who was alone and hungry, came to our mother's house and said,
"Please eat something," and "If you ask for something to eat, sit there," and sat her down
on the southern end of the right iser (bed). At that time, a five-year-old boy named Tolui
came in from outside and ran out in a hurry. Khargil Zhar jumped up, grabbed Tolui under
his arm, and ran with him, trying to pull out the knife. Altani, who was sitting on the left
side of the mother's house, heard her mother scream and shout, "My son, I have killed
him," and ran out. Khargil Zhar caught up with him, grabbed his hair with one hand, and
with the other hand, he grabbed the hand that was pulling out the knife, and he threw the
knife away. At that time, Jidai Zelme and his wife, who were slaughtering a black cow
behind the house, heard Altani's voice and ran over, still holding their axes and covered in
red blood, and hit the Tatar Khargil Zhar with their axes and stabbed him to death. When
Altani and Jidai Zelme took credit for saving the boy's life, Jidai Zelme and his wife said, "If
we hadn't run over and killed him right away, what could Altani, the only wife, have done?
She would have killed the boy. The credit for saving the boy's life will be ours." Altani said,
"How could you have come if you hadn't listened to my voice? If I hadn't run over and
grabbed his shaggy hair and pulled the hand that was pulling the knife and made him lose
it, wouldn't Jidai Zelme and his wife have already killed the boy?" In other words, the main
merit went to Altani. Borohul's wife, who helped her husband Borohul to become a lonely
island, also saved Tolui's life.
Also, when the Kherei and the Kharkalzan tribesmen were fighting, Ogedei was wounded in the neck
by an arrow, and Borohul, who climbed on top of him, drank the blood that spilled from him with his
mouth, and the next day, since Ogedei could not ride his horse, he stretched out in front of him,
sucked the warm blood that had formed with his lips, and brought the beloved son Ogedei back
alive. My mother, you have saved the lives of your two sons who have been raised with great pain.
Borohul, having become friends with me, added his voice to my call and continued to strive. Let
Borohul suffer nine accidents and not be punished, the order was given.
215. And he said, "Let me give you a daughter."
216. And Genghis Khan said to the old man Usun: "These four, Usun, Hunan,
Khokhochos, and Degei, do not hide what they have seen or heard, but always tell. The
Mongolian state
"There is a custom in the tradition of honoring the behi lords. Since it is customary to
make the elder generation a behi, let the family of the elder brother, Usun, be made a
behi. The behi is honored, wears a white robe, rides a white horse, sits on a high pedestal,
and chooses the date," the decree said.
217. And Genghis Khan said: "Khuildar has the merit of opening his mouth before the time
of the battle, so may his sons, grandchildren, and orphans receive the mercy and help that
is given to them."
218. And Genghis Khan, the son of Tsagaan Gua, said to Narin-Tooril: "Your
father Tsagaan Gua fought bravely and was killed at Jamukha in the battle of
Dalanbaljud. Now, receive the merit of your father and receive the help of
orphans." Tooril said: "My kindred is divided and scattered in many provinces.
If the king allows, let us gather our brothers and sisters." Genghis Khan
issued an order: "In that case, gather your brothers and sisters and rule over
the clan."
219. And Genghis Khan said to Sorkhon-shard: "When I was a little boy, when Targudai
Hiriltug of the Tais was jealous of me and his brothers, Sorkhon-shard's sons Chuluun and
Chimbai hid me and sent me away, saying that I was jealous of my brothers, and took me
to the care of my daughter Hadaan. I thought about your kindness in my dreams on dark
nights and kept remembering it in my heart on bright days. Then it came to me a long time
ago from the Tais. Now I will give you a gift. What gift do you want?" Sorkhon-shard and his
sons Chuluun and Chimbai said: "We, the land of the Mergids, want to live in Selenga with
our own free will. And let Genghis Khan know what gift he will give us!" Then Genghis Khan
said: "Defend the land, and possess the land until the Selenga clan, the land of Mergid, and
let them go, sharpen their bows and arrows, hold wedding feasts, and support their cups.
Let them not be blamed for the nine accidents!" He also said to Genghis Khan and Chuluun
Chimbai: "How can you forget what Chuluun Chimbai said before? Chuluun Chimbai, if you
want to tell me what you remember, or if you want to ask for what you lack, do not let
someone else tell you. Meet in person, tell me what you remember with your own words,
and ask for what you lack." He also said: "Sorkhon-shar, Badai, and Khishilig, you three
blacksmiths,
Attack many enemies
If you find something,
Let's get what we've found!
Take a break.
If you kill a deer,
"Take back what you have stolen!"
"Sorkhan-shar is a member of the Tudege family of the Thais. Badai Khishilig and
his wife are Chereng's horsemen. Now, become my shadar horchi (bow and
arrow wielder), raise a toast at the wedding, and celebrate with dignity!" the
decree said.
220. And Genghis Khan said to Nayad: "On the way to capture Targudai Khiriltug, along
with his two sons, the old man Shireet and Alan Naya, they reached the Khutgal meadow.
Nayad said: "How can we bear to hold our master the king?" They were not satisfied.
and Targudai was released and returned, and Shireet the Elder and his son Alag Naya
came with them. Naya said: "We, Khan Targudai, came with the hand of Hiriltu, and after
enduring the hardships, we came to give our strength to Genghis Khan. If he comes to
take the Khan, how can he trust the people who have taken their master? Since he could
not attack the Khan, he agreed with them and said that they knew the great etiquette of
helping (their) Khan, and ordered a certain matter. Boorchi became the ruler of the people
on the right. Mukhulai became the ruler of the people on the left. Now Naya will be the
ruler of the people in the center." 221. And Zev and Subedei, who had been taken away by
him, were given a thousand citizens.
"Make it yours."
222. And he gathered thousands of sheep from here and there and made them
lords of thousands.
223. Also, since there was a shortage of citizens to give to the carpenter Khutugur, the man of war, the
citizens gathered from the servants of other princes were simply given to Mulhalhu of Jadaran, and
Khutugur and Mulhalhu were given one thousand, and he advised them to give orders.
224. Having made those who worked hard to establish the state princes of the people, princes of thousands,
princes of centuries, princes of tens, and having given orders to those who gave orders, and having given orders
to those who gave orders, Genghis Khan issued an order: "In the past, I had eighty guards and seventy guards.
Now, by the mercy of the eternal heavens and the blessings of heaven and earth, my power has increased greatly,
and I have united the great state and brought it under one rule, so now separate for me a thousand guards. Let
them be made into ten thousand men, along with the guards and the guards!" the order was issued. Genghis
Khan also issued a decree to the princes of the thousandth dynasty regarding the selection and appointment of
the heirs: "When appointing my heirs, let the sons of the princes of the thousandth, the thousandth, and the
hundredth, and the sons of the free (free) men, who are equal to me in knowledge and good physical condition, be
selected. When entering my army, the sons of the princes of the thousandth dynasty, ten men (soldiers), and one
of their brothers, should come with them. The sons of the princes of the hundredth dynasty, five men, and one of
their brothers, should come with them. The sons of the princes of the tenth dynasty, and the sons of the free men,
three men, and one of their brothers, should come with them. In doing so, they should prepare their horses and
come from that place.
The sons of the princes of the thousand who will come to my army, take ten companions and their
belongings from among the subordinate thousand. Whatever the inheritance given by the father, or the
horses that you have acquired, whatever they have, they should prepare and bring them, free from property
interest, in the amount we have specified. The sons of the princes of the hundred, have five companions,
and the princes of the tenth and the sons of the weak, have three companions, and they should prepare
their horses and belongings, free from property interest, and in the same way!" was the order. "The princes
of the thousand, hundred, and tenth, if they hear this order of ours and disobey it, they will be severely
punished. "If a worthy person joins our army and makes it difficult for us to go with them, we will bring in
another person, punish him, and exile him to a distant place," the order was given. "Do not forbid people
who come to us to study with us." 225. According to Genghis Khan's order, the sons of the princes of
thousands, hundreds, and tens were sent separately, and the previous eighty beds were increased to eight
hundred. He said, "Add one thousand to eight hundred." The order was given, "Do not forbid people who
enter the beds by persuading them."
It was decreed that the Great One should rule the plain and be the ruler of the millennium. And
"Let four hundred horchni be appointed, and let the horchni be led by Yesun, the son of
Zelm, and commanded by Bukhedei, the son of Tuge." The Torguds and Khishigten were
assigned to four shifts, with Yesun in charge of one shift of horchni, Bukhedei in charge of
the other shift of horchni, Khorch-khudag in charge of the third shift of horchni, and Lablah
in charge of the fourth shift of horchni. Let the horchni, armed with bows and arrows, thus
command the horchni. Let the horchni be made a thousand, and let Esun rule!" was the
order.
226. "Let us increase the number of troops previously commanded by Oelen Cherbi to one thousand, and let the
Boorchi clan (descendants) be ruled by Oelen Cherbi. Let us also put another thousand troops under the command
of Bukha, the Muhulai clan. Let us also put another thousand troops under the command of Alchidai, the Ilugai
clan. Let us also put another thousand troops under the command of Dodai Cherbi. Let us also put another
thousand troops under the command of Dogolhu Cherbi. Let us also put another thousand troops under the
command of Chanai, the Dzorchidai clan. Let us also put another thousand troops under the command of Ahuidai
from the Alchi clan. Let us transfer one thousand brave soldiers under the command of Arhai Khasar, and let them
be the soldiers who will be rotated on ordinary days, and let them be the first to be sent out on the day of the
battle!" The decree was issued. The people who were selected from the many thousands were made eight
thousand troops. Together with two thousand bed and horchin, all of them became one thousand khishigten.
Genghis Khan issued a decree: "Let us strengthen our brave men and turn them into a mighty army!"
227. Genghis Khan also issued a decree to divide the daily shifts into four shifts and appoint
the leaders of the shifts: Bukha, to rule and correct the one-shift khishikt. Alchidai, to rule
and correct the one-shift khishikt. Dodai cherbi, to rule and correct the one-shift khishikt.
Dogolhu cherbi, to rule and correct the one-shift khishikt. He appointed the leaders to rule
these four shifts and issued a decree, and the leaders of the shifts were to list their
subordinates and assign them to shifts, and exchange them after three days. If a person
who has been given a shift breaks his shift, he will marry the one who broke his shift three
times. If he breaks his shift again, he will marry seven times. And if that person, who is
healthy and breaks the shift for the third time without the permission of the shift leaders,
marries thirty-seven of his wives, and considers him a person who has made it difficult for
us to be a slave, and exiles him to a distant place! It was ordered. The shift leaders must
make the three shift leaders hear this order every time. If they do not, the shift leaders will
bear the blame. It was ordered that if the order is heard, the shift leader who violates or
breaks the shift established by the order will be punished. The shift leaders are not to
punish the shift leader who is guarding with them without my permission, just because they
are the leaders. Tell the person who committed the crime. If we must execute (kill), we will
execute. We will make the one who must be executed lie down and execute. "Elders, if you
give me your hand and foot to marry, I will marry you in return for a dowry, and I will marry
you with a fist in return for a fist."
228. And Genghis Khan decreed: "My benefactor's common people are more important than foreign thousand-
year-old princes, and my benefactor's guide is more important than foreign hundred-year-old princes and tenth-
year-old princes. Therefore, if foreign thousand-year-old princes quarrel with my benefactor, the thousand-year-
old prince will be punished!"
229. And Genghis Khan issued a decree to the princes of the guard of the shift:
The guards of the guard shall go in rows in the direction of the shift and lie
down before sunset [the guards shall transfer their guard duties]
Let's go outside and spend the night. The soldiers of the camp will protect us at night. The archers and
the cooks will order the bowls and utensils to the camp and then go out and spend the night. The
archers, the torguds, and the torguds who were staying outside will wait there until we have eaten our
soup, and then they will inform the camp, and after we have eaten our soup, they will go inside, the
archers will take their bows and arrows, the torguds will take their places, and the torguds will take their
bowls and utensils and do their work. The people of the shift were ordered to follow this established rule
of rotation. "After sunset, let the guards hold the person who goes to the front of the palace
overnight and interrogate him tomorrow morning. Let him lie down, and when his guard arrives,
he will hand over his badge and be released. Let the guard leave and go."
The bed, guarding the entrance at night, should strike the shoulder of anyone who
tries to enter and behead him. If someone comes at night with urgent news, inform
the bed in advance and stay with the bed behind the house and speak from outside.
No one may sit on the bed base. No one may enter without the bed's permission. No
one may walk near the bed. No one may walk between the beds. No one may ask the
number of the bed. Anyone who passes by the bed should be arrested. The order
was that the bed should take the saddle and bridle of the person who asked the
number of the bed, and the full clothes he was wearing that day. Wasn't Eljige a
faithful man, but he was caught walking near the bed at night?

was the order.
231. "Think of the ninety-five thousand bounties that I have sent as my personal
property, and consider them as relics from my house, and take good care of them
without any harm, even to the descendants of my descendants, who will inherit the great
foundation after me. Is it possible not to honor these bounties as my noble bounties?"
he said.
232. And Genghis Khan said: "The daughters of the palace servants, the household servants, the camel drivers "Let the
oxen be tamed and know the palace chariots. Let the flags, tambourines, stirrups, and spears be tamed and know the
palace chariots. Let the cups and bowls be tamed and know the palace chariots. Let our food be tamed and know the
palace chariots. Let the sacrificial meat be tamed and know the palace chariots. If there is a shortage of food and drink,
let us ask for it from the palace chariots." "The palace chariots
"When distributing food, you cannot distribute it without the permission of the head of the
household. When distributing food, start distributing it from the household first." He said, "Let
the household know what goes in and out of the house. Let the household gatekeeper stand at
the door of the house. Let two householders go inside and lean on a big stick. Let the
householders search the area and bring down the household." He said, "When we take the
birds, let the householders take the birds with us. Leave some near the household cart for a
while."
233. And Genghis Khan said: "If our body does not go to war, then lie down, and we cannot
go to war without you." "If you know this decree and violate it with jealousy and send the
lying down to war, the commander of the army will be punished," the decree was issued. "If
you ask the reason for not sending the lying down army to war, then lie down, and I will
protect my precious life. I will suffer and suffer together when I catch birds and deer. I will
protect the camp and guard the chariot when I move. Is it easy to protect my body and
spend the night? Is it easy to protect the home chariot and the great aura (main camp)
when I move? Since they have such a dual function, it is because they are not sent to war
without us."
234. And the decree was issued: "Let the court hear and participate in the trial of the Shigihutu. Let
the court take care of the storage and distribution of bows, arrows, armor, and weapons. Let the
horses be brought and loaded." He said. "Let the goods be distributed with the hevtul and the
cherbi. When the horchins and torguds mark their territory and move, the horchins of Yesuntei and
Bukhedei, the torguds of Alchidai and Oelen Ahudai, go to the right side of the palace." He said.
"The cherbi of Bukha, Dodai, and Chanai, go to the left side of the palace." He said. "The ancient
heroes go in front of the palace." He said. "The hevtul, the ord, guarding the ger and chariot, go to
the left side of the palace." "All the nobles, the courtiers, and the sons of the court, the horsemen,
the shepherds, the camel drivers, and the cattle drivers, who go behind the court, are commanded
by Dodai Cherbi." "Dodai Cherbi, the scoundrel, is to follow behind the court, eating garbage and
collecting dung," was the order.
235. Kublai Khan was sent to the Harlags. When Arslan Khan of the Harlags joined Kublai, Kublai
Khan brought Arslan Khan and had him meet Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan praised Arslan for
following him without fighting and ordered him to give him his daughter. [Genghis Khan gave
Alkha Bekh to Arslan of the Harlags and issued the following order:
Be my feet when I jump, be my
support when I stumble, be my
horseshoe when I slip, be my
support when I stumble.
My beloved Alha, know this.
This body is fragile, but Your
name is eternal.
More than common sense
There is no good husband.
Better than foolish anger
There is no evil enemy.
Although there are many noble beliefs
It is useful to live a life of love
and warmth. It is useful to live a
holy life. It is useful to live a holy
life. A.to]
236. Subedei, the hero, led his army with iron chariots and attacked the sons of Togtoa of
Mergid, such as Hudu and Chuluun, and overtook and destroyed them at the Chui River.
237. Zev overtook and defeated Khuchulug Khan of the Naimans at a place called Sarigun.
238. The Uyghur Iduud Khan sent two envoys to Genghis Khan, saying: "It is as if the clouds have
cleared and the sun has shone, as if the ice has melted and a clear river has flowed. If Genghis
Khan accepts, I will take hold of the thread of your golden belt, find it in the thread of your sacred
robe, and become your fifth son." Hearing that, Genghis Khan accepted and sent back: "I will give
you my daughter. Let her be the fifth son. Bring gold, silver, pearls, tana, korgoi, embroidered silk,
and silk fabrics." When he sent back, Iduud was happy that he had accepted, and he brought gold,
silver, pearls, tana, silk, and silk fabrics and met Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan accepted Iduud and
gave him his daughter Alaltun Behi. [When Genghis Khan gave the Alaltun ink to the Uyghurs, he
taught them: "There are three husbands for a woman. The first husband is the golden state. The
man after him is the holy name. The man after him is the man who has been taken. If you follow
the golden state firmly, the holy name will be ready. If you strengthen the holy name, the man
who has been taken will not fall into the category." A.to]
239. In the year of the Rabbit (1207), Zuchi, taking the right-hand army, set out to conquer the forest
people, and Bukha invaded. The Oird (forest people) Khuduga Behi came with his entire tribe.
Khuduga Behi arrived, conquered Zuchi, and went through the territory of the entire tribe to Shigshi
(the Shigshi River). Zuchi, having entered the Oird, Buryats, Barga Urs, Habkhanas, Khankhas, and
Tuba aimags, reached the land of Tumen Hergis, when the Hergis princes Edi, Inal, Aldier, and
Ulebeg-tigin joined them, bringing a white falcon, a white horse, and a black sable, and met Zuchi.
The people of the Bayagids, including Shibir, Hesdin, Bayad, Tukhas, Tenlig, Tools, and Tas,
conquered the forest dwellers and brought back the princes of the Hergis people, the princes of the
millennial people, and the princes of the forest dwellers. They presented Genghis Khan with their
white horses, white horses, and black mules.
The Oirds welcomed the Khuduga Bekh from the front and invited him to join them, and his son
Inalchid gave him his daughter Checheikhen. Inalchid's brother Torelchid gave him the daughter
of Zuchi, Oluykhan. Alaga-bekhy gave the daughter to the Ongs. Genghis Khan, having greeted
Zuchi, said: "You are the eldest of my sons, you are the first to leave your home and travel well,
without losing people or horses, and you brought the inhabitants of the forest to the place you
reached. I will give you these inhabitants."
240. And Borohul Noyon was sent to conquer the Hori Tumd (Khori Buryat) people. After the death of
Daidukhul Sohr, the blind lord of Hori Tumd, his wife Botokhoi Targan ruled the Hori Tumd. Borohul
Noyon, having gone there, led three men and was leading the army through a narrow path in a forest
that was difficult to understand at night, when the guards of the Hori Tumd came out behind them,
blocked the road and captured Borohul Noyon. When Genghis Khan heard that Borohul had been
killed by the Hori Tumd, he was very angry and wanted to go on his own, but Boorchi Mukhulay and
Genghis Khan persuaded him not to. Note that the order given to Dorbei-Dogshin by Dorvedi was:
"Control the army firmly and
"Eternal heaven, try to conquer the citizens of the twenty-first century," was the order. The
commander took his army, went ahead of the army, sent a small army along the path guarded
by the guards, and deceived them, then he himself took a large army and advanced forward
under the red bull. In order to calm any soldier's heart, he gave each man ten rods (netlogs),
armed each man with an axe, ax, and a saw, and advanced forward along the path of the red
bull, cleared the path by cutting down and sawing the trees he came across, and climbed the
mountain and attacked the gathered citizens from the top of the mountain.
241. In the past, the Horchi prince and the Khuduga behi were captured by the Hori tribe and were living there in the
Botokhoi Targan.
The reason for the capture of Khorchi: When the order was given to take thirty beautiful women from the
Hori tribe, the Khorchi prince went to take the women from the Hori tribe, but the Khori tribe citizens who
had previously followed him became enemies again and captured Khorchi prince. When Genghis Khan
heard that Khorchi had been captured by the tribe, he sent Khuduga Behi as a person who knew the state
of the forest citizens, and Khuduga Behi was also captured. After capturing the Hori tribe, he gave a
hundred Tums to his family because of the bones of Borokhul. The Khorchis gave thirty girls. The fat
queen Botokhoi was given to Khuduga Behi.
242. Genghis Khan issued a decree and divided the citizens among his mother, sons, and
younger brothers: "My mother, who suffered greatly in conquering the country. My sons' elder
brother is Zuchi. My younger brother is Otchigin (otgon: fire khan, owner of the hearth)," and
when he gave one thousand citizens (ten households) to his mother and Otchigin, the mother
did not say a word. Zuchi gave nine thousand citizens. Chagadai gave eight thousand citizens.
Ögedei gave five thousand citizens. Tolui gave five thousand citizens. Khasar gave four
thousand citizens. Alchidai gave two thousand citizens. Belgutei gave one thousand five
hundred citizens. If we wanted to hide the fact that Uncle Daridai had gone with the Kheyd,
Boorchi Muhulai Shigihutu said to the three: "Isn't it like destroying your own hearth, like
destroying your own home? Isn't it your uncle who is the only one left from your good father's
house? How can we destroy him? Forgive him for not knowing how to dig. Let your hearth
smoke in the land of your good father's team," he said with a warm hearth, and when smoke
came out of his nose, "Okay, so be it," remembering his good father, Boorchi Muhulai
Shigihutu agreed to the three's words and calmed down. 243. "I, Otchigin, gave ten thousand
citizens, and Hhuchu, Hohochu Junso,
Argasun ordered four princes. Zuchid, Hunan Munkheur Hete ordered
three. Tsagadai ordered Kharachar Munkh Idukhadai ordered three.
Genghis Khan also said: "Since Tsagadai has a difficult and fierce character,
Khokho-chos, stay with him morning and evening and tell him what you
think." Ogedei ordered Ilugai and Degei. Tolui ordered Jidai and Bala. Hasart
ordered Jibege. Alchidai ordered Chaurkhai.
244. The seven sons of the father of the cave Menlig were seven. Among the seven sons was the
shaman Khokhochu Dev Tenger. The seven sons of that cave caught Khasar and killed him.
When Genghis Khan heard that Khasar had been captured by the seven cave men, Genghis Khan
was angry about other matters, so he said to Khasar angrily: "Aren't you a man who can't be
defeated by animals? Why were you defeated?" Khasar said, shedding tears and leaving. Khasar
was offended and did not come for three days. At that time Dev Tenger said to Genghis Khan:
"Guardian of the eternal sky, once Temujin,
"The king of the country will take over the country. Once, a prophet predicted that Khasar would take over
the country. If you don't be careful of Khasar, you don't know what will happen." Genghis Khan rode that
night and went to capture Khasar. Huchu Khokhochu and Oelun reported to Mother Oelun, "We went to
capture Khasar." Mother Oelun rode a white camel in a white chariot and traveled all night. When she
arrived at sunrise, Genghis Khan tied up Khasar's sleeves, took off his hat and belt, and interrogated him.
Genghis Khan saw his mother and ran away in fear. When his mother got out of the carriage, she
herself untied Khasar's sleeve cuffs, gave Khasar his hat and belt, and, suppressing her anger, sat
cross-legged, exposed her two breasts, held them on her knees, and said: "Do you see this?
These are your breasts that have been sucked. Those who bite your ribs and forcefully cut your
umbilical cord! Khasar, go! Temujin will suck the milk from this one breast. Khachiun Otchigin will
not suck the milk from the other breast. Khasar will suck the milk from both my breasts until they
are gone, and will make my chest full and comfortable. Thus, Temujin will have knowledge in his
chest,
The Khashar Khaw is strong, so
the Khatgaldan people are afraid.
By the power of a shot
It brings a lot.
Those who are missing
By the power of the arrow
It is brought in.
"Do you hate Khasar now that you have defeated the enemy?" he said. After calming his
mother's anger, Genghis Khan said: "I am very afraid and very ashamed of having angered my
mother. Let's stop doing this now!" he said. Without telling his mother, he secretly captured
some of the Khasar citizens and left 1,400 citizens in Khasar. When his mother Oelun learned of
this, she was deeply saddened and quickly grew old. Jalayirin Jibege, who had been given to
Khasar, left there and went to Bargujin.
245. After that, the nine-language (hamag) countries gathered at Dev Tenger, and many people
from the Chinggis Khan's court went to Dev Tenger to submit to him. Also, Otchigin, a subject of
Temuge, went to Dev Tenger. When Otchigin sent an envoy named Sohor to bring back his
citizen who had gone, Dev Tenger said to the envoy Sohor: "You and Otchigin, you are sending
great envoys," and the envoy beat Sohor and returned on foot, carrying his saddle. The next day
after the envoy Sohor was beaten and returned on foot, Otchigin himself went to Dev Tenger
and said: "If you send the envoy Sohor, beat him and return on foot. Now I have come to get my
citizen." Seven honkhots, Otchigin's envoys, stopped here and there, asking, "Is it right that you
send the envoy Sohor?" When they tried to beat him, Otchigin was afraid and said: "I was wrong
to send the messenger." The seven sons of the khan said: "If you realize your mistake, repent
and bow down!" and made Otchigin bow down to the sky. Then Otchigin, unable to get his
citizen back, returned the next morning when Genghis Khan did not get up and was in bed, and
came in crying and bowed down and said: "The nine-tongued citizens, who are gathered in the
sky, sent the messenger Sokhor to get their citizen from the sky. The messenger Sokhor was
beaten and came on foot carrying his saddle, but when I went myself, the seven khans blocked
me here and there and forced me to confess my mistake and repent. The sky
"He has been made to bow down," he cried. Before Genghis Khan could speak, Borte Ujin sat
up from the bed, covered his chest with the edge of the blanket, and, seeing Otchigin crying,
said with tears in his eyes: "What a difficult people those honkhots are! They once besieged
Khasar. Now why have they made this Otchigin bow down from behind?" What is this? [While
you were still alive, A.to] They are oppressing your many beautiful brothers like the pines of the
forest.
Since then they
If your body
disappears like a cloud,
Your great country is gone.
Will you let your children know?
Lately they have
If your glorious body
turns into a shadow,
Isn't it enough to destroy
your great country?
They are the oppressors of your
beautiful brothers, like the pines of the
high mountains.
Not yet grown up
I won't let your little children
know about the vast country.
What a difficult time for the honhotans! Are you going to spend it peacefully while watching
your younger brothers being oppressed like this?" Borte Ujin burst into tears. Hearing Borte
Ujin's words, Genghis Khan said to Otchigin: "Dev Tenger will come now. You know how to take
your revenge." With a sigh, Otchigin stood up, wiped his tears, and prepared three wrestlers.
Soon, Menlig came with his father and seven sons, and they all entered the house, sat on the
right side of Dev Tenger and Sun. Otchigin grabbed the hem of Dev Tenger's robe and said,
"Did you make me repent yesterday? "Let's see your strength," he said, dragging him towards
the door. Dev Tenger resisted Otchigin and grabbed the hem of his robe. As they wrestled, Dev
Tenger's hat fell onto the hearth. Menlig's father picked up the fallen hat, kissed it, and placed it
in his lap. Genghis Khan said, "Go out and show your strength." When Otchigin dragged Dev
Tenger over the threshold, three wrestlers who had been prepared met him, grabbed Dev
Tenger, dragged him, broke his back, and left him on the edge of the fence that the left-hander
had built. Otchigin entered and said, "Dev Tenger, you have been making me repent. Now, if
you want to see your strength, you are lying there in a state of denial." Menlig's father, knowing
the reason, burst into tears and said,
"The small homeland"
Just a little while ago
We met and became friends, I
am the Great River
Just a little while ago
"Because I met you, I"
Then the six sons of the khan closed the door and tried to invade the hearth by rolling up their
sleeves. When Genghis Khan was frightened and said, "Get out. Let's go," he left the house,
but the horchin torguds who were nearby came and surrounded him and protected him.
Seeing that the back of the chariot carrying Dev Tenger had broken, Genghis Khan ordered a
brown ger to be brought from the northern villages (back ger), placed it on Dev Tenger, and
said, "Prepare your weapons! Let's move." He moved from there.
246. If you build a house where the Dev Tengen is placed and close the door with a person, when the
dawn breaks on the third night, the house door will open and the Dev Tengen's body will be gone. If
you look closely, his body is really gone. Genghis Khan said: "Dev Tengen, because he touched my
brothers and spoke inappropriate words between my brothers, he did not agree with the will of
heaven, and heaven took both his life and body." Genghis Khan, while standing there, said to Menlig
father: "Because you do not persuade your sons to behave, they will fight us, and Dev Tengen's head
will be lost. If you knew that you would behave like this, you would have already become like Jamuha
Altan and Khuchar." He said to Menlig father, condemning him, saying, "Isn't it shameful to deny what
you said in the morning in the evening, and deny what you said in the evening in the morning?
"Wouldn't it be better if you stick to what you said before?" he said, and also made a decree, "If you
continue to behave in a bad way, who can be equal to the family of Mengli's father?" After the
disappearance of the heavens, the sons of the honkhot were subdued.
THE CONQUEST OF CHINA, TANGUDS, SARTAUL, BAGHDAD AND RUSSIA
247. After him, Genghis Khan, in the year 1211, set out to conquer the Chinese. He took Fuzhou
(now the Black Ruins near the White Wall), crossed the Fox Pass [to the west of the Assembly
Gate], and took Xun-de-fu (a place of worship to the northwest of Da-tung-fu), and sent Zev Hui-
khan and the hero as leaders. He went to Tsavchaal (the port of Qu-yun-guang), and reached the
fortress of Tsavchaal, where Zev said: "Let's provoke the enemy to leave the fortress and fight,"
and retreated his army. Seeing that Zev's army was retreating, he said: "Let's fight back," and the
Chinese soldiers covered the mountains and filled the valleys. Zev, who had reached Xun-de-fu's
head, turned and attacked and destroyed the enemy army that had come back. Genghis Khan,
taking his main army, arrived with a banner and chased the Chinese, defeated the best warriors
of the Kharkhiat, Zurchid, and Zhui, and slaughtered the Chinese army until it was exhausted. Zev
captured the gate of Zavchaal and crossed the mountain. Genghis Khan landed at Sharde. He
captured the city of Jundu (the central capital of the Golden Kingdom, now Beijing) and sent
troops to conquer many other cities. Zev was sent to conquer the city of Dongchang (the eastern
capital of the Golden Kingdom, now Liaoyang). Zev and Dongchang did not immediately capture
the ruins, but after six days of traveling back, he suddenly turned around and rode his horse all
night, attacking and capturing Dongchang while he was unaware.
248. Zev and Dunchang returned to join Genghis Khan after taking the city. While they were besieging the city
of Jundu, the great prince of the Golden Khan, Wangin Changsan, mentioned it to the Golden Khan.
He said: "Has the time of heaven and earth arrived, the time for the great settlement to be
moved? The Mongols have become very strong and have killed our brave and best black
Chinese, Zurchids, and noble soldiers of the Zhuyin. They have also captured the port of
Tsavchaal, which is very reliable. Now we can mobilize the soldiers, but if they are again
oppressed by the Mongols, their cities will be scattered in ruins and they will not be able to
gather again, and they will not trust us and will betray us and become enemies. If Altan Khan
agrees, let us make this friendship with the Mongolian king. If we make friendship and return,
after they return, we will make another proposal and advise them. The Mongol soldiers, it seems,
are struggling to withstand the heat of this place. Let us give the king a woman. Let us give gold,
silver, and goods to the soldiers and their leaders. How do we know if they will accept this
method?" Altan Khan agreed to Wangin Changsan's words and agreed to carry them out in this
way. He sent a princess to Genghis Khan to take gold, silver, and other valuables from Jundu and
give them to the soldiers to carry, and he sent Wangin Changsan as an envoy to Genghis Khan.
Genghis Khan agreed to their request and sent his soldiers who were fighting to conquer many
cities to come. Wangin Changsan followed Genghis Khan to the Mozhou-Fuzhou district and then
returned. Our soldiers loaded the valuables as much as they could carry and carried them on a
silk carpet.
249. From there, Genghis Khan went to the people of Khashin. (The Khan of the Tanguts or Si Xia,
known in Mongolia as Khashin Khan) When he arrived, the Burhan (lord) of the Khashin country
entered and said, "I will give you power as your right hand," and brought his daughter named
Chaga to Genghis Khan. The Burhan also said: "We have heard of the fame of Genghis Khan and
have been in awe. Now that your royal body has arrived, we are very afraid. Our Tangut country,
which was afraid, will give you power as your right hand." He said, "In giving you power, we,
Where you are
Locally inhabited
In the city of mud
Sits on a stool
Because people
Fast travel
Can't move fast.
In a fierce war
I won't be able to ride right away.
If Genghis Khan grants
The entire Tang Dynasty
In the highlands
The many camels I raised
Let's help by making an offering.
Hand-woven
The fabric is soft.
Let's give it as a gift.
Trained by means of force
Peregrine falcons
"All the best"
He kept his word and brought camels to the Tangut people,
without having to pay a tax on them.
250. Genghis Khan, in this event, brought the Golden Khan of China with him, took a lot of
wealth, recruited the Buddha of the Khashin (Tangud) country, and took many camels.
Thus, Genghis Khan, in that year, recruited the Golden Khan of China named Ahutai, and
recruited the Tangud citizen Ilahu Buddha, and returned to the Saar steppe.
251. And after that, many envoys sent to Zhouguan (or Zhou Khan of the Song Dynasty)
including Jubhan were killed by the Golden Khan of China, so Genghis Khan set out to fight
China again in the year of the Dog (1214). "Why did you send an envoy to Zhouguan when you
are friendly with us?" Genghis Khan set out to fight, and headed for the port of Dunguan, and
defeated Zev in the direction of Tsavchaal. When the Golden Khan learned that Genghis Khan
was going to capture Dunguan, he ordered his army to be led by Ile, Hada, and Khovegetur, and
also sent reinforcements, and sent Ulaan-degelen to the front to fortify Dunguan and not to
overtake the pass! He quickly sent the army of Ile, Hada, and Khovegetur. When Genghis Khan
reached the port of Dunguan, the Chinese troops covered the mountains and filled the valley.
Genghis Khan fought with the Ile, Hada, and Khovegetur, and drove the Ile and Hada back. Tolui
and the two sons of Chigu attacked from the side, repulsed Ulan-degelen, and attacked the Ile
and Hada from the flank, killing the Chinese until they were dead. Knowing that the Chinese
troops were almost completely destroyed, the Golden Khan retreated from the ruins of Jundu
and went to Nanjing (the southern capital of the Golden Kingdom, Bian Liang City, now Kai Fing
Fu, He Nan Province). The remaining troops starved to death, and in the meantime, they killed
each other and ate human flesh. Genghis Khan praised Tolui and the two sons of Chigu for
fighting well.
252. Genghis Khan landed at He-si-wu and then at the Yellow Steppe of Jundu. Zev and
Tsavchaal broke down the gates of the port, and from there he led an army to join Genghis
Khan. When Altan Khan left Jundu, he left a prince named Hada as his minister, Lu Shou.
Genghis Khan sent Ungur, Arhai Khasar, and Shigihutu to count the gold, silver, treasures,
and goods in the Jundu ruins. When the three arrived, Hada welcomed them, held a treasure
with gold patterns, and came out of the city to meet them. Hada told Shigihutu: "In the past,
this city of Jundu and the treasures of Jundu belonged to Altan Khan. Now Jundu belongs to
Genghis Khan. Why are you secretly stealing and bringing back the treasures of Genghis
Khan? I will not take them," Shigihutu refused. Ungur went down, and Arkhai and Khasar
took it. These three came and counted Jundu's things. There, Genghis Khan, Ungur, Arkhai,
and Shigihutu asked, "What did Khada give?" Shigihutu replied, "He brought me a gold-
plated, patterned vase. What I said was, "This Jundu used to belong to Altan Khan. Now it
belongs to Genghis Khan. Why would you give me a vase, Hada?" I said, "Why would you
secretly steal Genghis Khan's things?" I said, "Ungur and Arkhai took what was given to me."
Then Genghis Khan and Ungur rebuked him. He praised Shigihutu, saying, "You have
thought of great virtue," and said, "Are you not my eyes to see and ears to hear?"
253. Altan Khan entered Nanjing (the southern capital) and asked for friendship, and sent his
son Tenger with a hundred companions to Genghis Khan, saying, "Let us return." Genghis Khan
agreed to their request for friendship, and said, "Let us return," and ordered the left army to
Hasar to return through the Tsavchaal port, and sailed by sea.
He went by boat, landed at the northern capital called Beigin (Danin ruins), took that city, and then
marched on Fuhanu of the Zurchids. If Fuhanu (the eastern part of present-day Inner Mongolia) is
thinking of fighting, then fight! If he enters, he should march on its border cities, cross the Ula-nau
River, ascend the Taur River, cross the Khyangan Pass, and join the Great Aura Palace! He sent a
message to the Khasar, saying, "Let him come to the palace of the Great Aura!" The Khasar sent
three princes, Jorchidai, Alchi, and Tolun Cherbi. The Khasar entered the city of Beigin, took Fuhanu
of the Zurchids, captured the cities on the way, crossed the pass that gave the Taur River, and
descended to the palace of Genghis Khan.
254. After that, when a hundred envoys led by Ukhuna, who was sent by Genghis Khan to the
Sartaul people, were killed, Genghis Khan said: "Can we leave our golden path alone with the
Sartaul people? Let us avenge the revenge of the hundred envoys led by Ukhuna, and let us
fight against the Sartaul (Central Asian Turkestan) country." When Yesui Queen reminded
Genghis Khan of this, she said: "Khan
Overcoming the high pass
Across the broad river
When embarking on a long journey
The state governs its citizens
Think ahead.
Birth is a physical event.
The law of the wild animals
Remember your perfect mind.
If your body crumbles
like a mountain,
Who will rule your
country, Mongolia? If
your body, like a pillar, is
destroyed,
Who will raise your great
flag? Who among your four
sons will rule the country?
The Khan's sons and
brothers, the people and
the Queen, look at us all.
Will you answer?
Know the king's order"
If you say so,
Genghis Khan issued a decree: "The queen is a woman, but the words of Yesui are right! None of
you, the younger sons, Boorchi and Mukhulai, have remembered this word. I, as if I would not
follow the elders, have forgotten it myself. As if death were passing by me, I really did not
remember him," he said, "The elder of the sons is Zuchi. What do you say? Speak!" Before Zuchi
could speak, Chagadai said: "What are you going to appoint Zuchi to by telling Zuchi to speak? Are
we going to submit to the will of this Mergid?" (Borte Khatan said this because she was captured by
Mergid and became pregnant) Zuchi
He stood up and grabbed Chagatai by the shoulders and said: "King father, why do you single me
out when I have never been discriminated against? What knowledge do you have that makes you
superior to me? You are superior only in your fierceness. If you are defeated in a fight, cut off your
rights! If you are defeated in a fight, do not rise from where you have fallen! Know the orders of the
king father!" He said. Zuchi and Chagatai held each other by the shoulders and pulled Boorchi from
Zuchi's hand and Mukhulai from Chagatai's hand, while Genghis Khan sat silently. Khokhochos, who
was on his left, said: "What are you in a hurry for, Tsagadai? Your king father trusted you among his
sons. Before you were born,
The starry sky is rising.
Many countries are fighting.
Too busy to sleep in bed
They were being captured.
The earth turns into dust
The country is in crisis.
Too busy sleeping in a blanket
They fought fiercely.
Without hesitation,

He fought to the death.

"Don't hurt Sana!"
255. Then Genghis Khan said: "How can you say that about Zuchi? Isn't Zuchi the
eldest of my sons? Don't say that again." Chagadai was shocked by these words
and said: "The power of Zuchi will not belittle knowledge.
Killed by mouth
Unable to load.
Killed with words
You can't get sick.
Zuchi and I are the eldest of
my father's sons.
The king to his father
Let's join forces.
The one who escapes will be

Let's chop it down to the branch.
Because of the mercy of God,
It can be used for promotion.
In the presence of the king father
Keep it close together.
Baraat big hat
You can report it by holding it.
". At this, Genghis Khan said: "Zuchi, tell me what you have to say!" Zuchi said: "As
Tsagadai said, Tsagadai and I will join forces. Let's honor Ogedei!" Genghis Khan issued
an order: "What is annexation? The motherland is vast and has many rivers. Let's
conquer foreign countries and separate them. Let's expand our own territories. But you
and Zuchi Tsagadai, keep your word and don't become the laughing stock of the people
or the playthings of animals, and go in peace. In the past, when Altan Khuchar and his
wife fought like this, they did not keep their word and behaved in a bad way, you know
what happened. Now I will divide the subjects of Altan Khuchar and his wife among you.
See them and go as a punishment!" What will Ogedei say? "Speak!" he said. Ogedei said:
"When the king's father comes and speaks, what should I say? How can I say that I
cannot? Let me try to be able! Only the sons and grandsons of the future generation,
who do not eat cows wrapped in grass, nor dogs wrapped in fat, but shoot an elk and
hit a deer. What else can I say?" he said. Hearing these words, Genghis Khan issued a
decree: "Ogedei, it is time to say these words. And what will Tolui say? Speak!" he said.
Tolui said: "I will be with the brother named by the king's father, reminding him of his
forgetfulness, awakening him from sleep, becoming a cheerer at his call, becoming a
whip for his horse, traveling on long journeys and helping him in short ones," Genghis
Khan agreed and issued a decree: "One of his children shall succeed the khanate. Let
one of his children succeed Alchidai! Let one of his children succeed Otchigin! Let one of
his children succeed Belgutai! Let one of his children succeed Belgutai! Also, let one of
my children succeed me, and let my decrees not be changed, not broken, not broken,
not lost! If the children of Ogedei are born who are not eaten by cows wrapped in grass,
or by dogs wrapped in fat, will not a son be born in my family? ", the decree was.
256. Genghis Khan (west) rode into battle, sent an emissary to the Tangut state. The
messenger said: "Didn't you say I would be your right hand? I have lost my golden means in
the Saraul country and I am going to get revenge. Come as your right hand!"
Before the Buddha could speak, Asha Khambu said: "If you are not strong enough, what is the use of
the king?" He did not give any soldiers to help him and sent the messenger away with a lot of harsh
words. Then Genghis Khan said: "How can Asha Khambu be spoken like this? Wouldn't it be better to
go and fight with them first? But since it is time for someone else, let's do it this time. May you be
blessed by the eternal heaven and firmly pull back your golden helm, then perhaps!"
257. In the year of the Rabbit (1219), Genghis Khan took Queen Khulan from the queen, and
left Prince Otchigin of his brothers in the great palace, and crossed the Aray pass to fight
the Sartaul state. He sent Zev to Magnai. After Zev, he sent Subedei to the gezeg. Subedei
sent Togochar to the gezeg. When he sent these three, he ordered: "Go outside the Sultan
Khan's territory and come out behind us and join us when we arrive!" Zev went and left
without disturbing the ruins of Khan Mely. Subedei followed him without disturbing him.
While Togochar followed him, he plundered the cities on the borders of Khan Mely and
captured the peasants. Khan Melig, having destroyed his cities, moved away and joined
forces with Sultan Jalal-Din and fought against Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan led Shigihutu
before him. Sultan Jalal-Din and Khan Melig fought with Shigihutu and even chased them to
Genghis Khan. Zev, Subedei, and Togochar, Sultan Jalal-Din and Khan Melig fought behind
them and defeated them and did not let them enter any of the cities of Bukhara,
Semisgyab, or Otrar. When they reached the Shin River, the Sartaul army entered the Shin
(Indus) River and many of them drowned. Sultan Jalal-Din and Khan Melig fled to safety.
Genghis Khan went up the Shin River, crossed the Batkhesen, reached the Ekh and Gun
rivers, and landed in the Baruan steppe. Jalaldin Sultan and Khan Melig sent Jalayrin Bala to
ask for their help. Genghis Khan praised Zev Subedei very much and said: "Zev is your name
Zurgaadai. You came from the Tais and became known as Zev." Togochar and Khan Melig's
border cities were destroyed at will and Khan Melig became an enemy. He said that he
would kill him as a punishment, but instead of killing him, he severely reprimanded him and
deprived him of the right to command the army.
258. Genghis Khan himself returned from the Baruan steppe and sent his three sons, Zuchi,
Chagadai, and Ogedei, to command the right-hand army and cross the Amu River to the city of
Orgnechi (Gurganachi). Toluy was sent to capture many cities, including Iru and Isebur.
Genghis Khan himself landed in the city of Otrar. Zuchi, Chagadai, and Ogedei went and asked
the chief: "The army is formed. We have reached the city of Orgnechi. Whose word should we
follow?" When they sent them, Genghis Khan gave an order: "Let us follow the word of Ogedei."
259. From there, Genghis Khan landed in the city of Otrar and then moved on to the city of Semisgyab. From the city
of Semisgyab, he landed in the city of Bukhara. There, Genghis Khan waited for the prince Bala, and camped in the
camp of Sultan Khan on the Golden Gorge ridge, and sent a messenger to Tolui, saying: "The summer heat has
come. Dismount your troops. You come and join us!" He sent a message. Tolui took the cities of Iru and Isebur,
destroyed the city of Sisten, and destroyed the city of Chukhcheren, when the messenger arrived. Tolui destroyed
the city of Chukhcheren and returned and joined Genghis Khan.
260. The three sons of Zuchi, Chagadai, and Ogedei entered the city of Orgnechi and divided
the city and its citizens, but did not give a share to Genghis Khan. The three sons returned
When Genghis Khan arrived, he was angry with his three sons, Zuchi, Chagadai, and Ogedei, and did
not see them for three days. Then Boorchi, Mukhulai, and Shigihutu said: "We have weakened the
Sultan of Sartaul, who was fighting against us, and taken his city and citizens. The Orgnechi city that
will be divided and conquered belongs to Genghis Khan. Many of us, including our soldiers and
horses, are delighted and delighted that the sky and earth have increased in power and that the
Sartaul citizens have been weakened in this way. Why is the king so angry? The sons have realized
their mistake and are afraid. May the future be a lesson! The sons' behavior will not be forgotten.
If the king allows, can the sons be reunited?" Genghis Khan was relieved and brought together
the three sons, Zuchi, Chagadai, and Ogedei, and they made the words of the elders a legacy, the
old words a law, and they rebuked and condemned them until they were established and the
sweat on their foreheads was wiped off. When these three scoundrels, Honkhai, Hontahar, and
Chormagan, were reunited with Genghis Khan, they said to him: "How can you be like a young
black bear who has just come out of the forest, and discourage the sons' courage like this? The
boys should not be afraid. There are many enemy citizens from the rising sun to the setting sun.
If we send our Tibetan dogs (dogs) to fight, we will conquer the enemy country, increase our
power in the heavens and the earth, and bring you gold, silver, and all kinds of things! Which
country should we send to? There is a Caliph Sultan of Baghdad. (Baghdad is a large city on the
banks of the Tigris River, west of India and Iran). We will travel to conquer it! " He thought
critically about this word, and Genghis Khan's anger subsided and agreed, and he sent three
tsars, Khonkhai, Khonkhai, and Chormagan, and said to Adargin's Khonkhai and Dolongir's
Khonkhai, "Do not let me go with you!" and sent Chormagan of Udge to the Caliph Sultan of
Baghdad.
261. Also, the Aru-Maru Madsaari, who was between the Hindu (Enethegy) and Bagdad
peoples, sent the fierce Durvedi Durbei to conquer the city of Abtu in the country.
262. And Subedei the hero traveled through the eleven provinces of the north, including the
Khanlin, Hipchak, Bajigid, Oros, Magyars, Asu, Sasu, Circassians, Kashimir, Bolar or
Bulgarians, and Lala, crossing the Volga (Volga) and Yaik (Ural River) rivers, and reaching the
cities of Kivamen (Kivamen or Kiev) and Hermen.
263. After the conquest of Sartaul, when Genghis Khan ordered the appointment of heads of
cities and towns, a father and son named Yalavach and Mashud, a Sartaul of the Khoromshi
family, came from Orgnechi and discussed the customs of the cities with Genghis Khan. Since
they knew the customs of the cities well, they appointed the son Khoromshi Mashud, along with
the Mongol chieftains, to govern the cities of Bukhara, Semisgyab, Orgnechi, Udan, Hisgar,
Urian, and Gusandril, and brought his father Hormshi Yalavach to govern the city of Jundu
(Beijing) in China. Since Yalavach and Mashud knew the customs of the cities well, they
appointed Sartaul people as advisors to the Mongol chieftains who ruled China.
264. Genghis Khan spent seven years in Sartaul, waiting for Bala, the prince of Jalayr, when Bala
crossed the Shin River and pursued Sultan Jalaluddin and Khan Melig to the Indus region. Sultan
Jalaluddin and Khan Melig, having become depraved, returned after capturing the people of the
Indus region and taking many camels and goats. From there, Genghis Khan, on his way back,
spent the summer on the Irchis River, and in the autumn of the seventh year of the Rooster
(1225), he built a large camp in the Black Forest of the Tuul River.
265. That winter, he re-enlisted his army to fight the Tanguts, and in the autumn of the
year of the Dog (1226), Genghis Khan set out to fight the Tanguts. He took Queen Yesui
with him. On the way, in the winter, when many khulans were captured in Arbukha,
Genghis Khan rode a brown horse. When many khulans attacked, the brown horse
galloped and felled Genghis Khan. The Khan's body was very weak and he landed in a
place called Tsoorkha. That night, in the morning, Queen Yesui said: "My sons, talk to
me! The king's body has been very hot during the night." When the princes gathered,
Tolun Cherbi of Honghot said: "The Tang people, who live in the same place as they
were, live in mud cities, and live in mud cities, where will they go after leaving their
homeland and mud cities? Let us return, improve the king's body, and go to fight
again!" If the princes all agreed to that and told Genghis Khan, Genghis Khan said: "The
Tangut people will say that we have returned with a broken heart. We will send a
messenger, and when the messenger arrives, you can rest here in Tsoorkha and listen
to what the Tangut people have to say and return." He appointed the messenger and
composed a song (the official text is a poem and is easy to memorize, so it is called a
song) and said: "In the past, the Tangut people will be your right hand! You said that
God would help you. When we went to conquer the Sartaul people according to your
word, you did not keep your word, did not give you an army, but attacked with great
words. At that time, we were going to another country, so we went to the Sartaul
people to meet them later, and we were blessed in the eternal heaven, and conquered
the Sartaul people, and now God came to meet you." When he sent him, God said:
"Dairamh "I did not say a bad word." Asha Khambu said: "I said the word to attack.
Now, you Mongols, learn to fight and fight! I have people with caravans (khanates) and
camels in the land of Alasha. Travel to Alasha and come to me! Let's fight there! If you
need gold and silver, come to the cities of Yargai (Ningxia) and Erjiu (Xialian) if you need
it!" When Genghis Khan heard this, Genghis Khan said very warmly: "Well, that's not it.
How can we return when they say so much? Even if we die, we will not leave those big
words alone. Heaven knows!" Genghis Khan went to Alasha and fought with Asha
Khambu, besieged Alasha, captured Asha Khambu, and destroyed his caravans and
camels and citizens to ashes. "Let our soldiers capture and take captive those who
follow the Tangut tribe and their followers at will!" was the order.
266. Genghis Khan camped in the Tsast Mountains, sent his army, and followed Asha Kham,
carrying camels and camels, and captured the Tanguts who were hiding in the mountains.
From there, he ordered Boorchi and Mukhulai, "Take as much as you can from the Tanguts!"
and ordered: "Boorchi and Mukhulai did not give any Chinese citizens. "You two shall share
the Chinese national army equally! With their good men, catch your birds and lead them
away! With their beautiful women, mend the skirts of your wives! The Chinese national
army, the loyal servants of the Golden Khan, were the loyal servants of the Black Chinese
who harmed the ancestors of the Mongols. Now, you and Boorchi Mukhulai are my loyal
friends!" was the order.
267. When Genghis Khan set out from the Snow Mountain and landed at the city of Yargai, and set
out from the city of Yargai and destroyed the city of Turemgii (Lin-zhou), the Lord came to meet
Genghis Khan. There, the Lord met him and presented him with nine golden cups and nine silver
bowls, nine sons and daughters, nine horses and camels, and nine various things.
The Buddha was taken outside the gate. When he met him, Genghis Khan felt bad. On the
third day after that, Genghis Khan issued a decree, giving the Ilahu God a fair name, and
sending the Ilahu God to be righteous, Genghis Khan ordered that Ilahu be given the title of
Tolun Cherbi and healed him! The decree was issued. When Tolun Cherbi introduced Ilahu,
Genghis Khan issued a decree: "You are the Tolun who, on the way to meet the Tanguts,
took the Arbukhad khulun and said, 'I will heal my sick body.' We were angry at the enemy's
malicious words, and thanks to the power of the eternal heaven, we took revenge by
capturing the enemy. Tolun, you take the nomadic palace (dagsha ord) and the bowls and
dishes that Ilahu brought!" The decree was issued.
268. He conquered the Tangut state, gave Ilahu Barkhun a fair name, and crowned him, and
made the Tangut people completely free from the curse (to mark this by making them without
any descendants), and he ordered them to eat and drink and say, "The curse has been
removed!" and finish it off. The Tangut state, having confirmed his word, did not keep his word,
so he went to war again, and defeated the Tangut state. In the year of the Pig (1227) [on the
12th of the seventh month in the Turemgii ruins, A.to.] Genghis Khan ascended to heaven.
Before ascending, he gave a large number of Tangut citizens to Yesui. [The golden body of the
king was carried on a chariot, and when he ascended, the hero of the Sunid Giluge wrote a
poem in praise of him:
"My most valiant king, my lord, I have gone on
the wings of a black bird, I have gone on the
baggage of a resounding chariot, I have gone on
the wings of a chirping bird, I have gone on the
baggage of a chirping chariot"
"He sang in praise."
The chariot was pulled by five horses, and the great nation was suffering.
The hero of the Sunid Giluge said:
"My lord, born by destiny
from the blue sky!
Have you left your great country? Your
politics, which were founded by the Central
Government, Your noble sons, Your great
land and water,
Temujin the Great is waiting for you.
Your holy state is the nation of the
Almighty.
Your beloved queens and sons,
your Golden Ord mansion, are in a
distant land.
The state you led and established, the
queens you defeated, your sons you
are, the Mongols you are,
Many citizens of your country
The fallen spleen is far
away.
The Khiir flag is made from the
breasts of a steppe stallion.
Your slogan is the trumpet of the
Khengerek, Your country is not
spoken, Your island of Kherlen is
there, my lord! It happened
before creation.
Your beautiful queen, your
fertile land
Your friends, Boorchi Muhulai,
are a great nation.
There, my lord! Met
in incarnation
Your queen
Your sweet song is a song of praise,
the whole city is your country.
Your land and water are your honorable
(honorable) land. There, my lord! The
Haruuna mountain is warm, the Hari
Tangud are many, the Khata girls are
beautiful, have you forgotten all about
Mongolia, my dear lord!
"Even if you lose your warm life, let us
protect your body like a precious
treasure, my lord! Let us show it to
Queen Burtegeljy, and present it to all
the countries."
That's sick.
The king was merciful. The chariot
moved with a loud roar, and the whole
country rejoiced. The king brought the
great land there, buried the eternal
there, and the king's descendants
became the people of the whole
country, and the Eight White Houses
were established.
In this great country, a proclamation was made,
The shirt worn, the house and the home, The sock
wrapped in it, were unveiled there.
The truth is that some say that Burkhan Khaldun was the founder of Ongol, while others say that he was the founder of
the Altai Khanate and the Khentii Khanate in the land known as the Great Vyrat.]
269. In the year of the Rat (1228), the sons of Chagadai and Bat, who occupied the right bank, the sons
of Otchigin, Jeu, and Yesunhei, who occupied the left bank, the sons of Tolui, who occupied the river,
their princes, and the princes of the thousand-year-olds, all gathered in the Khedeu Island of Kherlen
(present-day Bayan-Ulaan), and according to the decree bequeathed by Genghis Khan, they honored
Ögedei Khan. Chagadai and his younger brother Ögedei Khan honored them with the throne, and
Genghis Khan gave the property of the khan, the khans, the khans, and the thousand-year-olds who
had guarded the golden life of their father, to Chagadai and Tolui and Ögedei Khan. The country of the
river was also given to Ögedei Khan.
270. Ogedei, the khan, having been elevated to the rank of khan, ruled the entire country of the river,
and having consulted with his brother Chagadai, sent Ogotor and Munkhot after the journey of
Chormagan, who had not yet been completed by his father, to the Caliph Sultan of Baghdad. He also
sent Subedei the hero to the countries of Khanlin, Hipchak, Bagidjid, Russia, Asu, Sasu, Magyar
Kashmir, Circassians, Bulgaria, and Kert, to conquer the cities of Meketmen, Hermen, and Keibe, and
having received news that the resistance of those countries was great, he ordered that the eldest sons
of the khan's family, led by Bat, Buri, and Munkh, be appointed as the chief of the khanate after
Subedei. He ordered that the army that had left the river be led by Guyug. The princes who ruled the
country should send their sons' elders on this campaign! The princes who did not rule the country, the
princes of tens, thousands, hundreds, tens, and anyone else, should also send their sons' elders! The
daughters of the khan should be sent and their sons' elders should be sent in the same way! This was
the decree, and Ogedei Khan said: "The proposal to send the sons' elders on this campaign was made
by Chagadai Akh. Chagadai Akh said: "Send each of your sons' brothers after the subedei. If the sons'
brothers go, the army will be abundant. If the army is many, the visible power will be great. There are
many enemy people there, and there are many foreign countries. Those border countries are difficult.
If you cheat, you will kill yourself. "He is a sharp-tongued man." He sent a proclamation to the far and
wide, saying, "According to this word carefully spoken by Chagadai, we will appoint the captain of the
sons!" and sent Bat, Buri, Guyug, and Munkh on an expedition. This is why he said, "This is the reason
why we decided to send the leaders of the sons to the expedition."
271. Also, Ogedei Khan sent a message to Chagadai Akha saying: "I am Genghis Khan, who has
taken up the position of his father. With what merit did he take up the position of khan?
Shouldn't I be asked? If Chagadai Akha agrees, let us go to conquer the Golden Khanate of
China, which our father left unfinished." Chagadai Akha agreed, saying, "What will we do?
Entrust your Aura camp to a good man and go! I will send an army from here!" He ordered his
great camp to Oldhar Horchin.
272. Year of the Rabbit (1231) Ögedei Khan sent a Chinese citizen to the country and sent Zev as his
leader. Then he slaughtered the Chinese army to the ground, crossed the Tsavchaal Pass, and sent
troops to blockade many cities in the south. At that time, Ögedei Khan became ill and could not speak.
When he was told by shamans and sorcerers that the landowners of China were destroying their
property and destroying their cities, he said that they were angry with the king because they were
harming the king. When people were asked to pay for their property, gold, silver, and animal meat, the
disease did not improve, but became worse. When he was asked to pay for his relatives, the king
suddenly opened his eyes, ran to drink water, and asked, "What happened?" The shaman
The emperor said: "The Chinese landowners have caused this disease by destroying the land and
destroying the people's property. When they ask for other things to be ransomed, they are even more
angry. They only agree to give a close relative as a ransom, which alleviates the disease. Now I know
what to do!" When they gave the order, Ogedei issued an order: "Who among the Khan's sons is with
me?" Tolui, who was nearby, said: "My lord Genghis Khan, when you had brothers above you and
younger brothers below you, the elder brother tested you like a horse, fought like a sheep, and then
placed you in a great position and entrusted you with the supreme responsibility of ruling many
countries. He told me to stay with the elder brother, reminding him of what he had forgotten and
awakening the sleeping. Now, if the elder brother loses you, whose forgotten will I remind him of and
whose sleeping will I awaken? If the elder brother becomes truly evil, many Mongolian countries will
become orphans and China will rejoice. Let me be the sacrifice in the place of the elder brother! I have
torn the back of a tul fish, I have cut the back of a sturgeon fish, I have defeated the ili and
suppressed the dal. My face is beautiful and my back is tall. May the shamans pray and pray!" He said.
The shamans prayed softly and made Tolui drink the blessed water. The little one sat down and said:
"I'm drunk. Until I recover from my drunkenness, the king will take care of my orphaned younger
siblings and my widowed daughter-in-law, and I will take care of them! I've said everything I said. I'm
drunk!" He said and left, getting worse.
273. Ogedei Khan then killed the Golden Khan and gave him the name of Xia-Si (servant),
seized gold, silver, and gold-embroidered robes, horses, and servants, appointed governors
and informers, and appointed governors in Nanjing, Jundu, and the cities of the south. He
returned safely and landed in the city of Khar Khoruim.
274. Chormagan Horchi led the army to Baghdad. Knowing that the land there was good and
noble, Ogedei Khan issued a decree: "Chormagan Horchi, also become the governor (tamgach) of
that land, and bring yellow gold, sharmal chimeg, horgoi, magnag, hiv, silk, pearls, tana, long-
necked, high-legged agmag horses, pack camels, mules, and other things every year!" He said.
Bat, Buri, Guyug, and Munkh, who followed Subedei, led many sons to Khanlin, Hipchak, and
Bajigid, crossed the Izhil and Yaik rivers, destroyed the city of Meged, and massacred the
Russians. They captured the citizens of the cities of Asu, Sasu, Bolarman, Hermen, and Kiva, and
left the chief governors behind them. The Zurqis sent the Yesuder Horchi after the Jalardai
Horchi, who had previously traveled to conquer Korea. He was ordered to make him the ruler
there!
275. Bat, from the land of Hipchak, secretly sent a message to Ogedei Khan: "By the power of
the eternal heaven, the king destroyed the city of Meged, conquered Russia, brought eleven
foreign countries to the north, and when he was about to leave, he built a large pavilion and
celebrated the wedding. At this wedding, I, the eldest of all the princes, drank a glass or two of
sarkhad. However, Buri and Guyug got angry with me and left the wedding. As they were
leaving, Buri said: "Bat and I are equal, why should I drink first?" He thought that he would
trample the bearded woman with his heel and trample her with his heel! Guyug said: "Let us
shoot at the heads of those women who are armed with bows and arrows." Argasun, the son of
Eljgen, said: "It would be better if they were given wooden tails." We, in a foreign and enemy
country, "I explained my reasons for leaving, but Buri and Guyug said such quarrelsome words
and left without friendship. Now, let the king know what to do!" he sent an apology.
276. Hearing this word of Bat, Ögedei Khan became very angry and, without letting
Guyu be present, said: "This aggressive ass, who listened to your words and insulted
your brother? A single bad egg has rotted. From your brother's face
He resisted. Let us send him to explore a distant land and let him push forward to conquer a
city as big as a mountain until his ten fingernails are broken! Let us make him the ruler of a
distant land and let him conquer a fortified city until his five fingernails are broken! Who did
the evil and aggressive Argasun imitate and speak such insulting words against our family? Let
us send Guyug Argasun and him together! Zui should kill Argasun. However, you are planning
to kill him. Tell Bata about everything! Tell Chagadai brother and send him! Chagadai brother
will know! "
277. The princes Mangai, Alchidai, Honkhordai, and Jangi, among the princes, recalled and
said: "Genghis Khan, your father's decree: The field will punish the field for the deeds of the
field, and the household will punish the hands. The king is now angry with Guyug. This is a
matter of the field. If the king so wishes, can you send this matter to Batu?" The khan
agreed with this and consoled himself, and then he met Guyu and rebuked him: "You left
no healthy people behind during the campaign. You took the skin off the face of a soldier.
Do you think that you followed Russia because of your anger? Did you think that you
brought a Russian citizen alone, and you raised a proud voice and rebelled against your
brother? Isn't it in the decree of Genghis Khan's father: "Many people are strong, deep
water is dangerous!" When you went under the wing of Subedei Bujig and gathered
together and brought in Russians and Hipchaks, why do you leave your home for the first
time and, without finding a single Russian or Hipchak, and without even getting a single
piece of adaglaval, act so aggressively and boast about yourself? But Alchidai and
Honkhordai Jangi, who have become friends to calm a troubled heart and become a ladle to
stir up boiling water, have become a source of anger "My life is in danger. Since this is a
crime, it is appropriate for Bat to punish this. Let Bat know about Guyug Argasun! Let
Chagadai ah know about this and punish him!" he said.
278. And Ogedei Khan issued a decree: "I hereby issue a decree to the guards,
guards, guards, and all the guards who were guarded by my father Genghis
Khan: Let the king follow the order of his father as before! The guards and
guards will take turns guarding the palace during the day, and when the sun
sets, if anyone enters the palace other than the guards, the guards will cut off
that person's head! If someone brings urgent news at night, let them stay
behind the palace with the guards and tell them the news! Let all that comes in
and out of the palace be known to you, together with the guards, Honkhordai
Shirkhan. Even if Eljigedei is a faithful man, he must follow the order, even if he
is a faithful man, he must not go near the guards and ask about the number of
guards. Do not go near the guards! Do not go between the guards! Pass by the
camp and arrest the people who enter the camp! The horse with the saddle and
bridle that the person who asked the number of camps rode that day, along
with all its clothes, must be arrested. No one may sit on the camp. The camp,
the flag, the tambourine, the stirrups, the spear, and the bowls must be taken
care of! The food, drink, alcohol, and meat juices must be taken care of by the
camp!" the order was given. "The camp, the army, the army, the army! When
we catch the birds, some of the army will guard the army and the army, and
some will go with us! The camp, the land, the army
The two nobles of the palace, Hadaan Bulhadar and, in turn, guard the right and left half of
the palace! Amal Chanar and, in turn, guard the right and left half of the palace! Hadi
Khorchi-khachar and, in turn, guard the right and left half of the palace! Yalbag Kharoudar
and, in turn, guard the right and left half of the palace! Also, Hadaan and Bulhadar's turn,
Amal and Chanar's turn, these two guards shall be stationed on the right side of the palace.
The four nobles of Hadaan shall be in charge of the palace. Also, my bodyguard shall
surround the palace and guard the entrance. Let the two men of the palace enter the palace
and hold it!" The order was issued. "And the four archers, Yesuntei, Bukhedei, Khorkhudag,
and Labalkha, who ruled the palace, divide their bows and arrows into four shifts, and each
shift will be commanded by its own guard!" The order was issued. "And the leaders of the
shifts of the shifts will be from the descendants of the people who previously ruled, and
Alchidai and Honkhordai, who previously knew, will jointly rule one shift of the shifts.
Temuder Jehu and Mangudai will jointly rule one shift of the shifts! Mangudai Gezeglur
(assistant) will rule one shift of the shifts!" The king also issued an order: "All the princes will
be led by Eljigedei, and they will follow Eljigedei's words! The watchman of the shifts, if he is
late, will be ordered by his three daughters according to the previous order! And if a person
misses a shift again, he will be beaten seven times! And if that person misses a shift for the
third time without a reason for illness and without the permission of the shift leader, we will
consider him a troublemaker, and we will beat him thirty-seven times and exile him to a
distant place out of sight. And if the shift leaders go on guard duty without registering their
subordinates, we will punish the shift leaders! And when the shift leaders change their shifts
three times, they will not let their subordinates hear this order. If a subordinate misses a
shift without hearing the order, they will be punished according to the order! If this order is
not heard by his subordinates, it will be the fault of the shift leaders. And the shift leaders
cannot arbitrarily punish my subordinates who are on guard duty with the name of the
leader. If they violate the rules, let them report it to us! We will kill those who must be killed.
We will punish those who must be punished. "Without being a senior, we are not allowed to
be intimidated by my superiors, and if they touch my superiors, they will be hit with a fist
instead of a fist, and a fist instead of a fist. My superiors are better than the outside
thousand lords. If the outside thousand lords quarrel with my superiors, the thousand lords
will be punished," the order was given.
279. And Ogedei Khan said: "Let us not disturb the country that Genghis Khan built with great difficulty. Let
us put our feet on the ground and our hands on the ground and rejoice. Let the king occupy the ready
foundation of his father and make it a priority not to disturb the citizens. Let us take a sheep from every
sheep of the state as a broth and take it every year. Let us take a sheep from a hundred sheep and give it
to the poor and needy in the country. And if many brothers are to be gathered in succession, it is not
appropriate to take the horses of the tribes from the people. Let us take a mare from every thousand in
the east and west, and appoint a local man to milk and groom the horses, and pay the debt and make
them foals. And when the princes and brothers gather, let us give alms. Therefore, let us store the goods,
money, axes, bows, swords, armor, and rust in the cellar of the house, and let that house be destroyed. Let
us guard it. Let us appoint guards and rice keepers from all directions to guard it. And let us divide the land
and water among the citizens. Let us divide the land
When choosing a settlement, you can select a local from each thousand. Also, there are no
animals in the desert Gobi except for deer. The people want to live in peace and quiet. Let's
send the local people led by Chanai Uygurtai and two to dig and fill a well in the desert Gobi.
Also, when sending messengers in the current way, the messengers travel slowly and the
people suffer a lot. Now we will regularly make it a rule to send out road warriors from the
thousands of miles around, set up stations at the base, and let the messengers not ride the
Uygurs and ride through the people, but only on the stationed roads. It seems right that
Chanai Bulkhadar and I thought of doing this and reminded us that we should do this in this
way, but Tsagadai ah understand! "If you agree with the actions that Edeger has said, let
Chagadai ah punish them!" He sent a message, and they agreed to all the actions that were
sent and replied, "Do as you say!". Chagadai ah also sent a message saying, "I will build a road
to meet you from here. And from here I will send a messenger to Bata. Bata will build a road to
meet you and connect you!" He also said, "It is right to say that we should build a road
between everyone, and it is right to say that we should do it!"
280. Then Ögedei Khan said: "This matter was agreed upon by Tchagadai ah, Bat, his right-hand sons, and all his
brothers. Otchigin noyon, Kehu, his left-hand sons, and all his brothers, the daughters of the river, the sons-in-
law, the princes of the people, the princes of the thousandths, the princes of the hundredths, and the princes of
the tenths. What was agreed upon was: Every year, a portion of each flock will be taken from each flock to be
used in the soup of Dalai Khan (Ogedei Khan was distinguished from the minor kings and is called the great king
or Dalai Khan). It would be good if a sheep from a hundred sheep was taken and a sheep was taken and given to
the poor and needy. It was agreed upon by all, and it was agreed upon that if a camp was set up, and a roadman
and a shepherd were sent, it would be peaceful for the people of many countries and convenient for the envoys.
After consulting Tchagadai ah, Tchagadai ah agreed, so that the king would send a thousand of his people from
all countries and from all directions to the king. By decree, every year, a sheep was taken from a flock of sheep,
and a sheep was taken from a hundred sheep. The donkeys were collected and a colt was put on the horse. The
colt driver, the groom, and the groom were appointed. The road driver and the horseman were appointed, and
the place where the horse was to be set up was determined, and the road was laid out, and the two Arachyans
and Toguchars were appointed, and twenty horsemen were appointed at one of the base stations of the road.
Each base station was equipped with twenty horsemen. The horsemen, sheep for milking, oxen for labor, and
carts were prepared in the prescribed quantity, and if one of the oxen was missing, half of the lips would be cut
off. If one of the spokes of the spoon was missing, half of the nose would be cut off.
281. Ogedei Khan said: "I sit in my father's great palace, and I have been the king since my
father's death. My deeds: First, I conquered the Golden Country. Second, I sent messengers between
us to communicate and conduct various affairs. Third, I dug wells in waterless lands, making the
people of the country have enough water and grass. Fourth, I placed informers and governors in the
cities of the country in the north and south, making the people of the country comfortable and at
ease. After the king, I added these four deeds. And while I was sitting in the great capital of the king
and taking on the great responsibility of governing many countries, I fell into the brown wine. The
first mistake was that I fell into the brown wine. Second, I fell into the wrongful words of an unworthy
woman and brought a girl from among the subjects of Otchigin uncle. Another mistake was that I fell
into the wrongful deeds of an unworthy woman while I was the king of the country. Third, I had a
secret suspicion of Dogolkhug. What is the mistake? Before the eyes of my king, I fell into the evil
words of Dogolkhug, who was the first to be bitten.
killed. Who will now lead me in this way? I myself will condemn the king for
unknowingly avenging a righteous man who served my father. Fourth, I was so
jealous of the deer born by the fate of heaven and earth that I built a mud wall and
heard the words of my brothers that I should not go to the land of other brothers.
This is another mistake. The king has added four deeds since his father. He has
committed four more mistakes!
282. The great council was held, and in the month of the seventh month of the year of the mouse (1240), the seventh
day of the Kherleni Khudeu Island, the writing was completed while the royal court was in session between Shilhintseg
and the king.
